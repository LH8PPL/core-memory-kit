**Windows EBUSY:** npm can't overwrite DLLs when loaded. Workaround: close Claude Code before updating.
**Marketplace refresh:** Claude Code plugin marketplace has auto-update OFF — requires manual `/plugin marketplace update`.
**Silent failure:** forgetting per-project re-scaffold. Solution: drift-check in `cmk doctor` flags version mismatches.

**Why:** These surface in real usage and block smooth UX in both paths (or are path-specific friction).

**How to apply:** Document Windows EBUSY upfront in npm guide. Add drift-check to `cmk doctor`. Clarify marketplace refresh in plugin guide.
