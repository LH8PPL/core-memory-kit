All PRs undergo full discipline: red-first tests (fail first, then fix), two-pass review, and concurrency stress tests on any surface with concurrent writes (5/5 first invocation). Failures and audit-premise errors are recorded honestly with full rationale (e.g., D-321: audit assumed bug that better-sqlite3 already handles).

**Why:** Ensures both quality and institutional knowledge. Honest recording of failed assumptions prevents repeating mistakes and builds trust in decision records.

**How to apply:** When submitting a PR: write red-first tests, request two independent reviews, stress-test concurrency surfaces, document interesting failures transparently.
