Stress runner writes JSON output incrementally and files may be mid-write/unreadable. Do not attempt to parse them directly; the stress runner itself parses and prints failing test names on completion, exiting non-zero on any failure. Trust the completion notification.

**Why:** Avoids wasted debugging effort on partial/corrupt JSON; runner handles it internally.

**How to apply:** When monitoring stress runs, ignore unreadable JSON files; wait for the runner's completion notification instead.
