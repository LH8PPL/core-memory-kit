Core-memory-kit is installed in this project with event hooks wired to Claude Code. Post-update sanity check: run `cmk doctor` and verify HC-1 (hooks registered) and HC-11 (backend CLI present) pass.

**Why:** Kit functionality depends on Claude Code version; after tool updates, hooks may break if versions diverge.

**How to apply:** After updating Claude Code or the kit, immediately run `cmk doctor` to confirm HC-1 and HC-11 are green. Troubleshoot before resuming work if checks fail.
