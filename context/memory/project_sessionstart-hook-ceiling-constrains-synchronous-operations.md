- **Hard constraint:** SessionStart hook ceiling is 30 seconds
- **Observed latency:** Real Haiku calls take 18–37 seconds on this machine
- **Impact:** Synchronous drain cannot reliably complete within budget; times out, falls back to detached path
- **Verified:** Detached (async) path succeeds, healing now.md on next session

**Why:** The live test (real `claude --print`, actual call latency) exposed that Q4's synchronous-drain goal cannot fit the hook ceiling. This is a hard architectural constraint determining solution viability.

**How to apply:** When choosing options A/B/C (sync vs. detached decision), use this constraint to evaluate feasibility. Sync operations must fit ~25s to leave margin; larger operations require detached paths.
