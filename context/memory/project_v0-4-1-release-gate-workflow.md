- Stage 1: `npm run release -- patch` → commit → push (local, not tag)
- Stage 2: `npm pack` + install tarball → verify `cmk --version` = 0.4.1
- Stage 3: Back up tier via Step 0b
- Stage 4: Run standing gates + new ★ gates (NR1: `npm run live-verify:now-roll`, NR2: HC-10 SKIP, NR3)
- Stage 5: Only after all ★ gates pass: push `v0.4.1` tag → CI publishes

**Why:** v0.4.1 introduces new now-roll and discovery gates; staged verification ensures all checks pass before publication

**How to apply:** Follow stages in order; paste results per stage for user diagnostics before moving to next stage
