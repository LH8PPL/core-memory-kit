After publishing a release, systematically verify that no documentation version-latest claims are stale. Key documents to check:
- tasks.md "Current state" header (typically the lag point): update to reflect latest version and upcoming queue
- RELEASE-PLAN: verify SHIPPED marker is present for the released version
- CHANGELOG: confirm [Version] section is dated, [Unreleased] section is present (auto-reset by release mechanic)
- README: verify no version-latest claims
- Task bodies: check for version-specific trigger conditions

Typical result: 0–1 lags per release (tasks.md Current state header is the most common lag point).

**Why:** Drift between published release and documentation claims confuses users and corrupts versioning narrative. Post-release reconciliation ensures docs remain authoritative.

**How to apply:** Run this check immediately after publishing. Update any stale headers, commit changes, and verify CI is watching identified files. This is now part of the standard release process.
