youtube-to-slide has been migrated from hand-built scheduled tasks to core-memory-kit management. Migration included deleting three legacy scheduled tasks (`ytslide-daily-memory-distillation`, `ytslide-weekly-memory-curator`, `ytslide-nightly-memsearch-index`), importing 7 existing sessions and 5 legacy project facts, healing the memory index (HC-4 PASS), and consolidating all memory operations under the kit's unified system.

**Why:** Eliminates duplicate task-scheduling systems (was two separate sets), enables unified health checks via `cmk doctor`, prevents the popup/crash issues caused by overlapping definitions, simplifies ongoing maintenance

**How to apply:** Future sessions assume youtube-to-slide is kit-managed; all scheduled distillation/curation runs through the kit; use `cmk doctor` to verify system health
