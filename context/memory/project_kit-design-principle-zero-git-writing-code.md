The claude-memory-kit ships with zero code that writes to git. All commits and pushes are user-initiated or delegated to external tooling.

**Why:** Prevents accidental or unintended commits; ensures user retains full control over git history; aligns with the kit's design philosophy as a passive memory layer.

**How to apply:** When designing kit features or fixes, avoid adding any git-writing operations or commit automation.
