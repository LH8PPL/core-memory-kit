Core discipline (recorded as `D-250`): When a tool reports status (exit code, gate color), verify by reading full logs first.

- **The lesson:** "it re-ran green" ≠ "I checked the error"
- A green exit code can mask a crash the tool merely tolerated
- The difference is discovered only by reading logs, not trusting exit codes

**Why:** Prevents false confidence and bugs masked by tool quirks. Enforces honest diagnostics instead of assuming exit codes are authoritative.

**How to apply:** After any CI gate flips, especially red→green on re-run, read logs before declaring victory. Critical for advisory tools where exit codes may not reflect actual success.
