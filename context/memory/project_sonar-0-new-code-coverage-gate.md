CI enforces zero-tolerance code coverage on new code via Sonar. Any new function or branch not exercised in tests fails the gate and blocks merge.

**Why:** Prevents untested code from reaching production; enforces code quality.

**How to apply:** When gate fails, identify uncovered lines (via Sonar API if needed), add targeted tests covering those branches, verify locally, retry CI.
