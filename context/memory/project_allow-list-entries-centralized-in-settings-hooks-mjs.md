The `settings-hooks.mjs` KIT_ALLOW function is the single write-site for all allow-list entries in the kit. Both npm and plugin distributions funnel allow-list generation through this one function. A format change (e.g., adding the wildcard Skill form) requires updates in only one place.

**Why:** Centralization prevents drift and inconsistency between distributions, making the kit maintainable and responsive to upstream changes.

**How to apply:** When fixing or extending allow-list entries, modify only `settings-hooks.mjs`. Verify changes via the install-hooks test suite.
