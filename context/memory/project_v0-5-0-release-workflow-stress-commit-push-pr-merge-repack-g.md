Release sequence for v0.5.0:
  1. Stress test (5/5) — must complete and pass
  2. Commit staged changes
  3. Push to remote
  4. Create PR and await CI green
  5. Merge PR
  6. Repack global (CRITICAL: kill mcp-serve PIDs first before repacking; mcp-serve must not be running during repack)
  7. Re-run Cursor gate (third and final agent gate for v0.5.0)

**Why:** Established workflow; mcp-serve PID kill is a non-obvious but required step to prevent repack failure or hang.

**How to apply:** For v0.5.0 completion, follow this exact sequence. For future releases, use as template. Never skip the PID kill step before repacking.
