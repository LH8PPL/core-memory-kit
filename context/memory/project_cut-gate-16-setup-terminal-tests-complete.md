Location: `C:\Temp\cut-gate16`
- Repo initialized, kit 0.3.3 installed with `cmk install --with-semantic`
- Semantic hybrid enabled, model cached (6s)
- Health checks: 5 pass / 0 fail / 3 skip (all structural tests green)
- MCP server registered in `.claude/settings.json`

Terminal-verifiable gates (G0–G7, RX1, FQ1, DJ1–DJ5): all passing

Status: ready for in-chat behavioral tests (M0–M3, W1–W4, DJ4-live, DJ6-live, F-7b-live, B-series)

**Why:** Clear checkpoint. Terminal half is done; prevents re-deriving setup in next session. Signals readiness for in-chat testing phase.

**How to apply:** Next session: (1) restart Claude Code targeting `cut-gate16` to pick up 0.3.3 MCP server, (2) run natural prompts from updated guide (M0–M3, W1–W4 tests, etc.), (3) document DJ6-live (session-end auto-sync proof), (4) verify F-7b-live (forget stays forgotten), (5) test B-series (capture/graduation).
