The file `docs/process/cut-gate.md` has an uncommitted modification (user's earlier edit, not made by assistant during this session). It was deliberately left untouched and requires a decision on resumption.

**Why:** Next session needs to know a file has pending changes and decide whether to commit or discard before continuing with the main Task 148 sequence.

**How to apply:** On next session, run `git diff docs/process/cut-gate.md` to review the change. Decide whether to `git add` and commit it, or `git restore` and discard it, before resuming the Task 148 resume sequence.
