- **root README** — GitHub front door; lean, concise structure
- **npm README** — package landing page; historically comprehensive with full CLI table (all 33 commands)
- **docs/CLI.md** — authoritative reference for all CLI verbs

The active tradeoff: npm README can either (A) mirror root's lean structure (consistent everywhere, but thinner) or (B) stay comprehensive/standalone (richer for npm visitors, diverges from root). npm visitors can't easily navigate to docs/CLI.md like GitHub visitors can.

**Why:** npm landing page serves a different audience than root — people evaluating the package need enough info to decide without clicks elsewhere. Consistency vs. comprehensiveness at each landing page is a real structural tension in this project.

**How to apply:** When revising landing pages, remember: audience != GitHub viewers. Lean mirrors should restore comprehensiveness somewhere visible, or ensure adjacent reference (docs/CLI.md) is equally discoverable from that landing page.
