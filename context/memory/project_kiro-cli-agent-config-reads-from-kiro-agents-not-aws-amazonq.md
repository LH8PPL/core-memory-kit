kiro-cli V3 (2.9.0+) reads agent configs exclusively from `~/.kiro/agents/`. The kit was writing to `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/` (amazonq CLI location), which kiro-cli never reads, causing silent discovery failure. D-198 fixed this by writing to the correct kiro path.

**Why:** Root cause of "cmk agent not firing in kiro-cli" despite D-197's logic fix being correct; explains the "dead file" symptom. Critical for debugging agent-not-found issues going forward.

**How to apply:** When testing/troubleshooting kiro-cli agent discovery, verify config location is `~/.kiro/agents/`. If migrating users from amazonq to kiro-cli, document path move as part of migration.
