- `cmk uninstall` removes only Claude Code managed surface (CLAUDE.md block + hooks), does not delete `context/` or even fully remove hooks
- Proposed `cmk uninstall --ide kiro` extends symmetrically: removes Kiro managed surfaces (.kiro/ blocks + ~/.aws agent) but never touches shared `context/`
- Design principle: each `--ide` owns its own install AND uninstall; `context/` (shared brain) is inviolable

**Why:** Minimizes accidental data loss and respects shared-brain architecture. Symmetric design makes tool behavior predictable and safe.

**How to apply:** When reviewing future uninstall behavior, verify it touches only agent-specific managed surfaces, never `context/`. This guards against deletion of irreplaceable shared state.
