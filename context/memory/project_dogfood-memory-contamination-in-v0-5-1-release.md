Six auto-extracted facts describing a Python FastAPI backend (gate-practice-app) contaminated Node CLI repo memory when cut-gate ran during dogfood session. All 20 facts were reviewed in full (not grep shortcuts). Six bleed facts tombstoned via `cmk forget`, 14 legit facts committed. Pre-commit screen verified no secrets/paths.

**Why:** Recurring dogfood contamination risk; cleanup process and cmk forget safety should be documented for future sessions

**How to apply:** When contaminated facts found, read all content fully, identify source, use cmk forget for safe removal (facts recoverable via archive/tombstones/), commit clean facts separately
