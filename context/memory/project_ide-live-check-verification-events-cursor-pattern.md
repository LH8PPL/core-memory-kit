Platform-specific IDE gates verify these hook + integration surfaces:
- **Hooks:** CH1 (capture-turn), CH1b (capture-prompt), CH2 (inject), CH3 (observe-edit), CH4 (fail-open)
- **Integrations:** M0–M2 (MCP in chat), W1–W3 (recall), E1 (cold-open session wedge)

**Why:** Comprehensive coverage catches missing hooks (like D-269) and subtle integration bugs (like CH3 wired-but-dead)

**How to apply:** When testing a new IDE, verify all hook events fire and integrations surface data in live checks; document each assertion
