kiro-cli's changelog explicitly documents that `env` is only passed to registry-type MCP servers, not stdio servers. This blocks the kit's original env-based approach (`process.env.CLAUDE_PROJECT`) from working when kiro-cli invokes the kit via stdio.

**Why:** This limitation was discovered during debugging and is documented in kiro's own changelog. It is a hard constraint of how kiro-cli routes configuration to MCP servers.

**How to apply:** Do not rely on env for passing the project path to the kit via kiro-cli stdio. Use command-line args instead (the --project workaround).
