Before launching expensive multi-agent runs (e.g., Wave-2 with 10+ agents):
1. Do a cheap/narrow verification pass to identify hallucinated or duplicate systems
2. Then run the expensive full pass only on confirmed-real targets

This is *not* cost-saving; it's quality-saving. Filtering bad targets "makes the re-run sharper, not smaller" by avoiding wasted deep-reads on invalid systems.

**Why:** Expensive runs can burn budget fast (e.g., 36 agents last instance). Filtering up-front prevents re-runs and improves signal.

**How to apply:** Always verify targets before expensive multi-agent tasks. The cheap pass catches hallucinations; the expensive pass runs only on confirmed targets.
