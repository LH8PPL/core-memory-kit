UTF-8 byte-order marks (BOM) were breaking JSON.parse during Cursor bi-turn capture. Fixed in v0.5.0 with TDD and end-to-end verification (full suite 2833/2833 passing). Documented in CHANGELOG, D-306 doc, and Task 207.

**Why:** Real bug in Cursor Windows capture of agent interactions; now resolved and thoroughly tested before release.

**How to apply:** When testing JSON parsing in Cursor hooks or similar systems, verify BOM handling is correct. Reference D-306 if similar issues arise.
