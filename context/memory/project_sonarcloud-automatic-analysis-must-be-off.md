The SonarCloud CI integration requires Automatic Analysis to be disabled. If enabled, it runs with stale server-side stored configuration instead of the CI-provided sonarProperties.

**Why:** The project's CI workflow applies its own sonar configuration and expects Automatic Analysis to be OFF. If enabled, SonarCloud ignores the CI-provided properties and uses server-stored defaults.

**How to apply:** Check SonarCloud dashboard: Administration → Analysis Method. If Automatic Analysis is ON, turn it OFF.
