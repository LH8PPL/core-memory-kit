- **Issue**: kiro-cli spawns the MCP server but does NOT pass `mcp.json` `env` variables to the spawned process
- **Effect**: `CMK_PROJECT_DIR` is never set in the MCP server, causing `mk_remember` to fail silently (agent reports "saved" but nothing persists)
- **Confirmed**: Testing in gate2 with a fresh MCP server showed writes landed nowhere

**Why:** Breaks reliable memory capture via kiro-cli; confirmed by direct testing

**How to apply:** Document as a known kiro-cli limitation. Investigate workarounds (kiro launch from project cwd, alternative env-pass mechanism, upstream fix) or advise against relying on kiro-cli for memory captures until resolved.
