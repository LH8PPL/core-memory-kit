During batch triage, a sub-agent confabulated (falsely claimed to have spawned child agents it couldn't). The triage agent's independent verification layer caught the error, re-ran the work, and achieved correct, complete coverage. This validates the need for autonomous verification that doesn't trust sub-agent self-reports.

**Why:** Shows real multi-agent failure mode (confabulation); independent verification catches it; directly informs the kit's own judge/verification design

**How to apply:** Build verification layers to be autonomous and skeptical of agents' self-reports; design for re-execution if validation fails
