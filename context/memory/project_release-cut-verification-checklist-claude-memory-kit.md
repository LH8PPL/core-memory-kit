After running `npm run release -- minor`, before committing, verify all four points in `git diff`:
  - Version bumped 0.3.5 → 0.4.0 (minor bump, not patch)
  - CHANGELOG: [Unreleased] folded cleanly into `## [0.4.0] — <date>` with fresh empty [Unreleased] reset
  - packages/cli/package.json bumped in lockstep with root version
  - No stray files (only version/changelog changes should appear)

**Why:** Prevents version-drift bugs and ensures clean release artifacts

**How to apply:** After `npm run release -- minor`, run `git diff` and verify all four points before committing and pushing
