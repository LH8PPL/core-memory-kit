`C:\Temp\kiro-ide-gate10` is the designated folder for the D-303 auto-extract re-test.
- Baseline: 6 pass · 0 fail · 5 skip (HC-1 and HC-11 PASS; HC-4 shows 0 fact files)
- Main CI: 0 failures (not blocking)
- Next step: run live Kiro test (state casual preference → turn ends → auto-capture fires → verify via `cmk search`)

**Why:** Confirms which folder to use; baseline cleanliness validates it's a fresh slate where any facts appearing after the test are unambiguously from auto-extract, not prior state.

**How to apply:** Run the Kiro re-test in this folder as outlined in previous notes; **do NOT run `cmk remember`** — the fix in v0.5.0 hooks should auto-capture the stated preference on turn-end.
