Five non-negotiable security tests in release validation:
  1. **Poison_Guard:** Real API keys are rejected with exit code 2
  2. **Home-path sanitization:** OS paths like `~` are scrubbed from stored facts
  3. **Username leak prevention:** Tested under heavy real exposure; zero leaks detected
  4. **FTS5 special chars:** SQLite query-language special characters do not crash full-text search
  5. **Unicode safety:** Invisible/zero-width Unicode sequences are detected and blocked

**Why:** The memory system must safely handle real credentials, workspace paths, and user data without accidental leaks or crashes in production.

**How to apply:** Before tagging a release, verify all five checks pass. Poison_Guard failure is a release blocker. If any check regresses, investigate before proceeding to tag.
