The old `validate-skill-sources.mjs` used a custom lenient parser (naive line-split) that failed to catch invalid YAML. Specifically, it did not detect SKILL.md descriptions lacking block scalars. Fixed by switching to strict `js-yaml` parsing (PR #220, commit b5f37a6). Added a regression test to prevent the parser from reverting to leniency.

**Why:** Custom parsers can be dangerously lenient and hide real validation bugs, especially risky for YAML where strictness matters.

**How to apply:** When writing validators for YAML/JSON, use the strict standard library parser (js-yaml, not custom). Write tests that confirm the validator catches known-bad inputs.
