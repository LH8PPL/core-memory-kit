The core-memory-kit implements guards (D-192, D-193) that prevent agents from destructing memory files or directories, even if the agent attempts alternative shells or rerouting. This is intentional and designed to prevent accidental data loss.

**Why:** Memory systems require strong protections against agent-initiated destructive operations. The guard correctly blocks the agent, leaving such operations to the user.

**How to apply:** When memory-related deletions are necessary, the agent will be blocked. The user must run destructive commands directly outside the agent runtime (e.g., from the shell).
