- `engines.node`: >=22 (documented as BREAKING change in CHANGELOG)
- `.nvmrc`: 22
- CI configured to run Node 22
- Breaking change motivated by better-sqlite3 v13 upgrade; eliminates deprecation warnings (prebuild-install v7)

**Why:** better-sqlite3 v13 has a hard Node 22 floor. This is a breaking change for users on Node <22.

**How to apply:** Future sessions must remember this floor. If backporting or supporting older Node, this is the constraint. Use for decisions about what versions to test against.
