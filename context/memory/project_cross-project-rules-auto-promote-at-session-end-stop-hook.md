The claude-memory-kit automatically promotes cross-project doctrine (rules marked "in every project" or "from now on always") to the user tier (HABITS.md) at session end via the stop hook. Mechanism: session-end-tasks.mjs runs `autoPersona` on the stop hook, which reads the per-turn fact corpus and auto-promotes cross-project rules. This is the designed primary path; explicit `cmk lessons promote` mid-session is an optional alternative.

**Why:** Understanding the auto-promotion flow prevents confusion: users don't need manual promotion commands to land cross-project rules in HABITS.md. The kit handles promotion automatically at session close, reducing friction.

**How to apply:** Capture cross-project rules normally with `cmk remember`. Exit the kiro-cli session to fire the stop hook. Auto-promotion to HABITS.md happens automatically—no manual `cmk lessons promote` needed.
