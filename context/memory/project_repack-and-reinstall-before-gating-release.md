Before running the cut-gate procedure, the npm tarball must be repacked from the fixed branch and reinstalled globally. This ensures the gate runs against the fixed binary, not a stale pre-fix build. Procedure: (1) repack tarball from fixed main, (2) stop MCP servers to free the native binding DLL, (3) npm reinstall globally, (4) verify installed files. Skipping this risks gating against a buggy build.

**Why:** The kit's global instance is what the gate uses. Running against a pre-fix tarball causes the gate to pass broken code.

**How to apply:** Before each gate run, execute the repack+reinstall sequence and verify the installed version matches the fix.
