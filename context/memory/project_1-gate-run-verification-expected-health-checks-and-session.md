After `cmk doctor` completes with **5 pass · 0 fail · 4 skip**, the gate is verified. Proceed as follows:

**Expected health check results:**
- PASS (5): HC-1 (hooks registered), HC-4 (INDEX sync), HC-6 (auto-memory status), HC-7 (locks), HC-8 (bindings)
- SKIP (4): HC-2 (daily distill), HC-3 (transcripts), HC-5 (cron), HC-9 (scaffold version) — all normal for fresh install

**Session 1 handoff procedure:**
1. Restart Kiro (fully close + reopen) to load new hooks/skills/MCP
2. Open `C:\Temp\kiro-gate` and start Session 1
3. **First watch**: Hooks should fire silently (no Run/Reject prompt). This is the **KH-trust** live confirmation that D-194 (trusted-commands pre-trusted working) is actually live.
4. Verify capture: Check `context\sessions\now.md` to confirm session capture fired (KH1 live proof)

**Why:** The gate run proved all three blockers are fixed and working (D-195 SKILL.md valid, D-194 trusted-commands, Task 164 memory lint-clean). Silent hook firing is the critical confirmation before Session 1 proceeds.

**How to apply:** After §1 completes with matching health check results, restart Kiro and watch for silent hooks. If hooks fire silently and `context\sessions\now.md` has content, D-194 is confirmed live and Session 1 can proceed normally. If Run/Reject prompt appears, investigate before continuing.
