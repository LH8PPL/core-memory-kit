SonarCloud is the final CI gate in the PR workflow (after coverage thresholds and full test suite). It has previously detected ReDoS vulnerabilities not caught by functional tests or coverage checks.

**Why:** SonarCloud provides security-focused static analysis. Understanding its role and historical effectiveness (catching ReDoS) explains why it's the final merge gate.

**How to apply:** Treat SonarCloud as a security-focused gate. If it flags an issue, fix it before merge — it has a proven track record of catching real vulnerabilities.
