Patches (v0.5.x) are cut on-demand, not pre-planned. A new patch version is triggered only when user-facing fixes accumulate in [Unreleased]. [Unreleased] is currently empty — all work on main since v0.5.5 is internal (research notes, decisions, dev-dependencies, CI, tests).

**Why:** Prevents unnecessary release churn; users only receive patches for genuine user-facing fixes. Clarifies why v0.5.6 does not pre-exist.

**How to apply:** When planning releases, check [Unreleased]. If empty, proceed to the next minor version. Cut a patch only when [Unreleased] contains user-facing fixes.
