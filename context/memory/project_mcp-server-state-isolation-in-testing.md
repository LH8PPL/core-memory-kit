Stale MCP servers from previous runs can mask test results by holding old environment state. When validating kiro-cli's delivery of mcp.json `env` to spawned processes, pre-existing server instances prevent clean testing.

**Workaround:** Kill all stale MCP servers before re-testing in a fresh project folder. This ensures the new diagnostic runs with a guaranteed-fresh MCP server spawn, isolating variables.

**Why:** Without isolation, a test result can be false-positive or false-negative due to stale env state from a prior run. Killing old servers ensures the test truly validates the current code path, not cached behavior.

**How to apply:** Before each diagnostic round, check process list for lingering MCP servers (e.g., PID 17648) and kill them. Then re-run in the fresh test folder to generate clean output.
