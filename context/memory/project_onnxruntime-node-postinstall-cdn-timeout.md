The postinstall script for onnxruntime-node occasionally fails due to transient CDN timeouts. This is a known, documented issue not related to code changes. Workaround: re-run the failed step.

**Why:** Future sessions should recognize this as transient infrastructure noise, not a real code problem, and know to retry rather than debug the code.

**How to apply:** When npm install or CI jobs fail with onnxruntime-node postinstall errors, re-run the step. If it persists across multiple retries, then investigate deeper.
