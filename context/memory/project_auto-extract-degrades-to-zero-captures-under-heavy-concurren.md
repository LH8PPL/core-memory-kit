Auto-extract degrades to ZERO captures under heavy concurrent load in the same session. Evidence 2026-07-20: 6 of 6 extractions ended haiku_timeout, each burning the full 90s budget (duration_ms 90030), while the session ran subagents, full test suites and 24-way concurrent spawn probes. Normal days show the opposite ratio (74 successes/6 timeouts on 07-01, 52/3 on 07-15, 111 successes across two sampled days). So the loop is NOT broken - it is starved, and it fails SILENTLY: nothing in the chat says 'your last 6 turns were never captured'.

**Why:** This is a silent-degradation class, the worst shape for a memory kit: the user believes capture is automatic, the hook fires every turn, and the only evidence of total failure is a phase:extract error_category:haiku_timeout line in context/sessions/DATE.extract.log that nobody reads. On a heavy session - exactly the sessions richest in durable findings - the automatic path can contribute nothing while appearing healthy.

**How to apply:** Two directions, both cheap: (1) SURFACE it - HC-* health check or a doctor line that reads today's extract.log and FAILS when the success rate is 0 or the timeout rate crosses a threshold, so 'my memory did not capture today' is visible without reading NDJSON; (2) SURVIVE it - on haiku_timeout, fall back to a deterministic no-LLM capture (the turn's user-stated durable lines) instead of dropping the turn entirely, so a starved loop degrades to partial capture rather than zero. Do NOT just raise the 90s budget - that trades silence for slowness.
