The claude-memory-kit D-264 (empty-snapshot) fix verification uses a multi-stage pipeline before merge:
- **B1**: Upstream gate removed (root cause)
- **B2**: Test repaired and proven red-on-main (`expected '' to match /uncommitted/i`)
- **I1**: DECISION-LOG rewritten with missed probe signal documented
- **M1**: False positive check (single blank line — not a real issue)
- **Full suite test**: 59/59 passing
- **Skill-review**: Agent-based code review running
- **Final-code stress test**: Sequential (after full suite finishes to avoid runner collision)

All three gates (suite, review, stress) must pass green before committing.

**Why:** Ensures comprehensive testing, code review, and stress validation before merge. Sequential stress-test approach prevents test runner collision (discovered earlier this session).

**How to apply:** When working on fixes in this project, follow this complete gate structure. Run stress test AFTER full suite completes, not in parallel.
