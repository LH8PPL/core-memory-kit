The `validate-docs` system structurally enforces citation patterns for `ADR-NNNN`, `FR-N`, `Task N`, and `§N.N`. However, it does NOT validate decision-log IDs (`D-nnn`), allowing them to drift undetected. This contradicts the project's thesis that prose rules should not rot.

**Why:** Systematic validation is core to the project's argument; this gap leaves a category of citations unguarded.

**How to apply:** Extend `validate-docs` to check `D-nnn` patterns, or explicitly document why they are excluded.
