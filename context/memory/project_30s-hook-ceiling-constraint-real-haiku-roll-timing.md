The npm hook ceiling is **30 seconds**. Real `claude --print` (Haiku) command execution takes **18–37 seconds**, exceeding this hard constraint.

The original Q4 design (synchronous drain at SessionStart) violated this ceiling. Live test revealed it; design analysis alone would have missed it.

**Why:** Hard environmental constraints (hook timeouts, resource limits) emerge only during real execution, not during design phases.

**How to apply:** When designing hook-based or time-sensitive operations, live-test with real execution before finalizing. The 30s ceiling is a hard constraint.
