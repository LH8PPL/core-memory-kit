- After PR merges, re-install kit fresh from main branch (not dev tree), then re-run the entire CLI cut-gate sweep
- Verify that all created files reflect what actually ships

**Why:** Dev tree may have transient state; only a clean build from main branch proves the product is correct

**How to apply:** After any merge affecting CLI functionality, before tagging/release, re-install kit fresh and re-run full cut-gate sweep
