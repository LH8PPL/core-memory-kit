Before squash-merging a release PR into main:
- Verify SonarCloud quality gate passes (new_coverage threshold met, no new security hotspots)
- Confirm PR CI fully passes (all tests green)
- Ensure "the rest is green" (all other status checks)

Only if all gates pass: squash-merge PR → pull main locally → user tags & pushes (`git tag v<version> && git push origin v<version>`).

**Why:** Gate checks prevent shipping broken or incomplete releases; mandatory discipline for release safety.

**How to apply:** Apply this gate-check-before-merge discipline to every release. Do not merge if any gate fails.
