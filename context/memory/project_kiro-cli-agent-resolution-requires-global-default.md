Kiro-cli reads agents from both global (`~/.kiro/agents/`) and project-local locations. However, `chat.defaultAgent` (auto-activation setting) is global-only in kiro.dev scope. Therefore, cmk must use global agent config + global default, not project-local setup like Claude Code.

**Why:** Architectural constraint from kiro-cli's Amazon-Q lineage. Explains why kiro-cli cannot match Claude Code's project-local agent pattern.

**How to apply:** When installing cmk for kiro-cli, wire `~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json` and set as global default. This topology is required and permanent.
