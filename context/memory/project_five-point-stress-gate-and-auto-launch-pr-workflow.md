The project uses a 5-point stress gate for the "hook surface" that runs on the "final tree" before merge (~10 minutes per run). The gate validates fixes for specific bugs including dup-import count, positioned tail read, and flake root-causes. When all 5 gates pass (5/5), a PR opens automatically with the full trail of fixes. Downstream workflow: PR opens → CI → merge → housekeeping (D-137) → next queue item.

**Why:** Stress gating is a quality validation before merge. The auto-launch on pass keeps the pipeline moving predictably without manual gate-watching.

**How to apply:** When the stress gate fails, plan to re-run it. When all 5 pass, expect the PR to open automatically. Track gate status as a leading indicator for PR availability.
