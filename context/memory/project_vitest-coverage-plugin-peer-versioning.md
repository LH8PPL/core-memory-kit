`vitest` and `@vitest/coverage-v8` are peer-versioned (both 4.1.9)
Must merge together, never separately
Separate merges risk coverage/runner version mismatches causing CI breaks

**Why:** Misaligned versions break coverage reporting or test execution

**How to apply:** Consolidate Dependabot PRs for these two locally; use `npm update vitest @vitest/coverage-v8` to sync
