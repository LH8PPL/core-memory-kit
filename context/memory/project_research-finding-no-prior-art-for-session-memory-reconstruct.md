- **Main claim**: No prior art exists for reconstructing session memory from commit history.
- **Near-hits**: claude-mem uses git log for recency detection; Letta's memory_repo uses git as storage backend. Both are different from Task 174's approach.
- **Missed precedent**: The project's own Graphiti note already states "git history + audit.log — our committed-markdown shape **is** the system-time record". This documents the underlying concept but wasn't cited initially.

**Why:** Future research should start from "this is the only published approach to date" + the caveat that Graphiti articulated the core insight earlier in house.

**How to apply:** When documenting Task 174, cite the Graphiti note as prior conceptual work. When evaluating new memory/history features, use this as the reference point.
