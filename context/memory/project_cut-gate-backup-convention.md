Cut-gate backups live in a central root C:\cut-gate-backups\, one folder per run named NN_version_gate (e.g. 12_v0.4.0_kiro), each holding BEFORE-/AFTER- snapshots + NOTES.md. NOT flat in the home dir anymore.

**Why:** Flat backups cluttered the home dir, had no structure, and were easy to fat-finger in cleanup. Central + structured = safe to bulk-manage and AFTER-snapshots are evidence to diff against the next run.

**How to apply:** Before a gate: back up ~/.claude-memory-kit (move) + ~/.aws (copy — real creds) into the run folder. After: copy AFTER- artifacts, restore the user tier, delete only the cmk agent files from ~/.aws. The Kiro gate (cut-gate-kiro.md §0c/Verdict) encodes this; scripts/maintenance/migrate-cut-gate-backups.ps1 consolidated the old flat ones.
