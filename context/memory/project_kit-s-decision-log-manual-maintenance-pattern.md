The claude-memory-kit build repo maintains `DECISION-LOG.md` (entries D-1 through D-131+) as a chronological decision journal. This predates the kit's ability to dogfood itself and remains the authoritative record of decisions; the kit's memory system provides recall over it. Manual editing has kept it a first-class artifact.

**Why:** Both the kit team and peer projects (Squad) independently maintain chronological decision journals, suggesting this narrative form provides value that individual-fact storage doesn't. The kit chose to keep D-log authoritative rather than migrate to the fact model.

**How to apply:** When evaluating a decision-journal feature (digest extension or new view), use D-log's structure as proof of concept. Understand why the kit team hasn't migrated from manual maintenance—that informs design tradeoffs for auto-rendering vs. hybrid approaches.
