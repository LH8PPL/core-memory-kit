Before shipping, each finding is: (1) verified for authenticity ("is this real?"), (2) marked SAFE with justification or queued for fix, (3) logged in decision record (e.g., D-128). No release ships until all findings triaged.

**Why:** Catches false positives; provides audit trail for future readers auditing why each decision was made.

**How to apply:** Apply to all future releases. Every finding gets a written justification; every decision gets documented.
