This repo has 1455 facts in its index (~471 uncached for embedding). Today's `cmk install --with-semantic` switched from FTS (keyword search) to hybrid semantic search. This is the first time semantic mode has been active.

**Why:** Context for why the memory leak manifests here (scales cleanly on empty repo, unbounded on 1455 facts).

**How to apply:** Use 1455 as baseline when testing semantic features or performance; verify sublinear scaling.
