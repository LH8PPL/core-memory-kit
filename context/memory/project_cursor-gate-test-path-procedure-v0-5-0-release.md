To execute the Cursor gate test:
1. Fully quit and reopen Cursor
2. Open the folder: `C:\Temp\cursor-gate-v050e` (contains the fixed v0.5.0 binary)
3. Run the S1 build arc (Kiro prompts), stating preferences casually
4. Verify that now.md fills with both user and assistant turns and auto-extracted facts land
5. This closes the Cursor gate and clears the path to v0.5.0 tag

**Why:** This is the final gate before v0.5.0 release. Windows Cursor capture bugs (D-305 path, D-306 BOM) are fixed. Claude and Kiro gates already passed.

**How to apply:** Reference this procedure when ready to run the Cursor gate re-run; it's the last step before tagging v0.5.0.
