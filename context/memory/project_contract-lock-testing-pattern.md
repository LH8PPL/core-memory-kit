Tests that assert the invariant or contract itself, not just that an operation succeeds or errors. Example: D-163 contract-lock test verifies "the forgotten *body never appears*" in the MCP response text, even when recovery is possible. This catches partial leaks (e.g., accidental body inclusion in search results) that a simple "error: not found" status check would miss.

**Why:** Status-code tests verify the happy/error paths but miss contract violations; contract-lock tests catch edge cases and breaches directly.

**How to apply:** When a feature touches an invariant or safety contract, add a test verifying the invariant itself (not just operation success).
