- **Root cause**: The SonarCloud job in `ci.yml` was missing the `actions/cache@v5` step for HF-model downloads.
- **Failure mode**: Without cache, HF-model fetches are rate-limited, fail, semantic tests abort before writing lcov → SonarCloud receives zero coverage report → gate fails.
- **Fix**: Add `actions/cache@v5` to SonarCloud job, mirroring the cache config in the main CI job.
- **Additional fix**: ReDoS hotspot in `auto-persona.mjs:438` (logged as D-155).

**Why:** Failure cascade was non-obvious and blocked the v0.3.1 gate; worth capturing for future SonarCloud troubleshooting.

**How to apply:** When SonarCloud reports zero new coverage unexpectedly, check if the job is missing the cache step. Sync it with the main job's cache config.
