FQ1 fix (FTS5 `prepareFtsQuery`) is confirmed present in installed 0.3.2 on disk. DJ2 idempotency fix affects digest path only (`decisions-journal.mjs`).

**Why:** Session 2 tests recall via `mk_search` (MCP server), which requires FQ1. Clarifies that rebuild is unnecessary for S2.

**How to apply:** Verify FQ1 presence by checking disk for `prepareFtsQuery` occurrences. Don't rebuild before Session 2 unless testing the digest path.
