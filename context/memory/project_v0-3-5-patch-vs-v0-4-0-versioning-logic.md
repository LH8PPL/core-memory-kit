v0.3.x = within-paradigm polish and targeted fixes. v0.4.0 = single committed differentiator (Kiro cross-agent). When a task is important but doesn't warrant re-prioritizing the minor, route to v0.3.5 patch rather than folding into v0.4.0.

**Why:** Preserves single-differentiator rule, ships important fixes sooner, doesn't delay committed work.

**How to apply:** If a fix is wedge-critical but doesn't change v0.4.0's headline (Kiro), slot as v0.3.5. Fold into v0.4.0 only if it's part of the committed differentiator or you're deliberately re-opening the decision.
