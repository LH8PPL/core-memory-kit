Added binding rule to CLAUDE.md derived from a publish-failure lesson. **The rule:** watch CI on direct-to-main; run full validators on doc changes before committing.

**Why:** A prior publish-failure revealed CI was not checked on direct-to-main, and validators only caught the issue post-release. This rule prevents recurrence.

**How to apply:** When working on this project, before pushing or committing doc changes to main, verify CI checks pass and run the full validator suite locally.
