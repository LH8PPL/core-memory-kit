- Root `README.md` and `packages/cli/README.md` must contain identical content
- Changes to one should always be applied to the other
- Both are actively viewed and kept in lockstep

**Why:** Users access the project via different entry points (root repo vs npm package); content consistency is critical

**How to apply:** When editing README, apply the same change to both files; verify sync after any README edit
