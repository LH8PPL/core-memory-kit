- Live-test phase before tagging discovers real bugs that automated test suites miss (e.g., 1857+ tests did not catch `cmk repair --index` seam-injection or `<private>` leaking to files)
- Fixes validated with TDD + file-content verification + live-proof + skill-review validation
- File-creation verification is critical—`<private>` leak surfaced on-disk, not in code review

**Why:** Live testing plus on-disk file verification surfaces boundary violations and single-point-of-enforcement failures that automated tests alone cannot detect

**How to apply:** For any future cut-gate, include live-test phase before tagging; always verify created files match expected content and do not contain unintended markers
