- Vitest runner buffers stdout until run completion; empty output file early in execution is normal and does not indicate failure
- Reliable proof-of-life: inspect process table for active vitest worker processes (6+ processes over 100 MB each indicate healthy run)
- Do not rely on spawn reports or output file state to confirm execution; process table is ground truth

**Why:** Previous session reported gates "running" when both had actually died; trusting spawn output instead of inspecting process state produced false confidence

**How to apply:** When monitoring long-running vitest stress tests, verify via `ps` or process table inspection for active workers rather than output files or spawn assumptions
