For ad-hoc test/repro scripts + scratch files, NEVER use the dev repo path (C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit) or the home dir (~ as the working/output location — always use c:\temp or c:\tmp.

**Why:** The user rejected a repro that ran inside the repo dir, with the standing rule: never use C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit or ~ for testing. Scratch/repro files must not pollute the repo (git noise, accidental commits) or the home dir.

**How to apply:** When writing a one-off repro/probe/scratch script or its output, put it under c:\temp or c:\tmp (mkdir if needed), not the repo and not home. The kit's own sandbox tests already use os.tmpdir(); this rule is for MY manual diagnostic scripts.
