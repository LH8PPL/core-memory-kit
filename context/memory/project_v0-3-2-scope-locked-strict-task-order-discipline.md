**Scope (5 committed, 1 conditional):**
- 153: FTS5 query sanitization | S
- 154: .gitattributes LF-pinning | XS
- 152: validate-index-completeness | S
- 147: cmk digest + DECISIONS.md | S
- 134: Poison_Guard catalog extension | S
- 141b: node:sqlite migration | M | conditional on both spikes passing

**Execution order (strict):** 153 → 154 → 152 → 147 → 134, then run 141b spikes last to decide if 141b ships in v0.3.2 or defers.

**Why:** Dependencies and risk management. Spike results for 141b decide whether it ships in v0.3.2 or defers to v0.3.3.

**How to apply:** Next session working on this patch: follow this exact order. Refer to tasks.md and RELEASE-PLAN.md for task details. Do NOT reorder without explicit rationale.
