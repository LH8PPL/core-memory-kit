- Global tier: `~/.claude-memory-kit` — USER, HABITS, LESSONS, fragments/INDEX
- Project tier: `cut-gate14/context` — MEMORY, SOUL, memory/INDEX, settings.json, logs
- Local tier: `cut-gate14/context.local` — machine-paths, overrides (not committed)

Each tier has a specific role: global user/habit knowledge, project state, machine-local config.

**Why:** Understanding the tier structure is essential for correct memory placement and avoiding committed-tier leaks.

**How to apply:** When auditing or working with memory files, verify across all three tiers. When adding facts, choose the correct tier based on scope (user, project, or machine-local).
