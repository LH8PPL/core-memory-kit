Extract-fallback.mjs is correctly wired into error handler and runs on any failure. 9 timeouts occurred before install (all pre-15:36); fallback has never been exercised. Next timeout will reveal if it works by checking for `fallback_written` in extract log.

**Why:** Need to confirm feature works before claiming it's production-ready

**How to apply:** Monitor for next timeout; check extract log for `fallback_written` field to confirm fallback caught it
