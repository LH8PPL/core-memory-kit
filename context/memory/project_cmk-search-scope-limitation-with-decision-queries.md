Running `cmk search --scope decisions` on v0.5.3 returns no results for name-history queries, even though ADR-0012 and decision records exist. Full trail is in ADR-0012 and tasks.md.

**Why:** Future session might assume no name-decision history exists if relying only on search.

**How to apply:** For name-change history, use ADR + tasks.md. Note as potential enhancement: index decisions by default or improve scope-search discoverability.
