The `cmk hook promptSubmit: capturePrompt` hook fails with "capture boom" on every stress run (5/5 observed). The failure does not block the stress gate — all runs complete and pass successfully.

**Why:** A future session might encounter this hook failure and wonder if it's critical; knowing it doesn't block the gate prevents unnecessary investigation.

**How to apply:** When you see this hook failure in future stress runs, treat it as a known, non-blocking issue.
