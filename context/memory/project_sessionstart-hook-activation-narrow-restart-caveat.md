**When restart is needed:** `cmk install` or extension update runs in a terminal window, then Claude Code is opened in the *same* window before the session loads the updated hook. In this case, a full restart (quit + reopen) is necessary.

**When restart is NOT needed:** `cmk install` completes in terminal, *then* a new Claude Code session is opened. The hook is already on disk at SessionStart.

The E1 run followed the second pattern (install, then `code .` in fresh session) — no restart was necessary and the result proved it.

**Why:** Overgeneralized "always restart after install" becomes a nonsensical instruction in the common case (open fresh). The rule should only apply to the corner case (install into already-open window).

**How to apply:** If documenting this caveat, phrase it as a corner case, not a blanket rule. Make clear when restart is actually required vs when it is automatic.
