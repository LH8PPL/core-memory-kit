79 accumulated context files (75 fact files + MEMORY.md/DECISIONS.md/INDEX.md) committed as separate chore commit (3602f6c), distinct from code commits to preserve signal clarity. Pre-commit: name-privacy validator confirms no home-path/secret leaks. Gitignored tiers (sessions/, transcripts/) correctly excluded from staging.

**Why:** Memory system integrity requires clean signal separation, privacy assurance, and gitignore discipline.

**How to apply:** On future memory commits: (1) run privacy validator, (2) stage only context/ files, (3) commit as `chore(memory)` separate from code, (4) verify gitignore tiers not staged.
