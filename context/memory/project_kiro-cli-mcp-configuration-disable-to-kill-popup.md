Set `includeMcpJson: false` in `~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json` to disable MCP server spawning in kiro-cli. This eliminates the cmd.exe popup window. The change is **scoped to kiro-cli only** — Claude Code and Kiro IDE continue using MCP (they read `.kiro/settings/mcp.json` directly, bypassing agent config).

**Why:** kiro-cli was spawning a non-functional MCP server, causing an annoying popup (issue #5873). Disabling MCP here removes dead weight while preserving MCP for other surfaces.

**How to apply:** Apply only to kiro-cli agent config. Test that popup is gone after `npm pack` + reinstall. Document that Claude Code / Kiro IDE remain unaffected.
