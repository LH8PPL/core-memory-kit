SonarCloud's server-side Analysis Scope settings (stored in the web UI) take precedence over and cannot be overridden by any repo-side changes—file exclusions, sonar.projectBaseDir, or properties in package.json. Stale Windows paths or file inclusions stored in Analysis Scope cause analyzer crashes and persist even after repo-side config changes.

**Why:** The analyzer loads both repo-config and server-config with server-config winning. Once a path is stored in Analysis Scope, it persists until manually cleared from the web UI.

**How to apply:** If repo-side sonarProperties changes don't resolve an analyzer crash or unexpected file scanning, check Analysis Scope in the SonarCloud web UI (Administration → Analysis Scope). Confirm server-side origin by grepping the repo; if the path/artifact isn't present locally, the fix requires the web UI.
