Global cmk build is now at v0.5.0 (upgraded from 0.4.4). Verified content:
  - Task-148 markers in transcript-screen.mjs (3 matches)
  - SonarCloud ReDoS/unicode fixes in pii-patterns.mjs (INVISIBLE_CODEPOINT_HEX, 2 matches)
  This is the artifact for the current gate cycle (Sessions 1–3, §0–§5).

**Why:** Anchors artifact version and contents; future sessions can verify baseline without re-deriving

**How to apply:** When resuming gate work, confirm global `cmk --version` = 0.5.0 and scan for Task-148 + SonarCloud markers before running Sessions 2–3
