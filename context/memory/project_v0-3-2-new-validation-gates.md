v0.3.2 introduces two new validation gate categories:
- **FQ1** (FTS5 fix) — located in §4 of the cut-gate guide
- **DJ1, DJ2, DJ3** (digest + DECISIONS.md) — located in §4c of the cut-gate guide

These gates must be verified during the release cut-gate process.

**Why:** These are new features shipped in 0.3.2; knowing their guide locations ensures they are tested during release validation.

**How to apply:** As you proceed through §4 and §4c, explicitly check for FQ1 and the DJ gates. They are part of the expected "all green" outcome.
