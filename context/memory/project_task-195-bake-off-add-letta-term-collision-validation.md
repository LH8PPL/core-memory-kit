When Task 195 validates the core-memory-kit rename (post-Cursor+Codex), must check:
- Letta/MemGPT uses "core memory" as a technical term for its always-in-context memory block
- This is potential term collision in the exact domain we operate
- Semantic alignment is possible (the kit IS an agent's core memory), but requires conscious review
- Decision checkpoint: is collision survivable? semantically confusing? safe to proceed or pivot?

**Why:** core-memory-kit is the leading name, but validation defers until Cursor+Codex ship. Letta's existing "core memory" term is a specific checkable constraint within that bake-off.

**How to apply:** In Task 195 bake-off, research Letta "core memory" semantics and decide before lock-in: does overlap matter; is it aligned or confusing; safe to proceed or alternative needed?
