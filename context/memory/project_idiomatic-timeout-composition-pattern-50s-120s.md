The codebase uses a 50s/120s timeout composition as the canonical design pattern, documented in §16.42. This pattern appears across promote sites: detached children inherit the 120s ceiling-free default; SessionEnd sites pass explicit 50s. Composition has been verified in both directions.

**Why:** This is the standing design pattern for timeout decisions; adhering to it ensures consistency and correctness across timeout-related changes.

**How to apply:** When modifying timeout logic (especially at SessionEnd or promote sites), consult §16.42 and follow the 50s/120s composition pattern as the idiomatic approach.
