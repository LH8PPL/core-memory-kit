Path comparisons in discovery walkers failed silently when one side used short names (8.3 format) and the other used full names.

**Example**: `TAMIR~1` vs `tamir.bn-sh` — same path, but comparison didn't match.

**The fix**: Use `realpathSync.native` to canonicalize paths before comparison.

**Why:** Without this, project discovery could fail intermittently depending on how cwd was specified (short vs long form), especially on Windows.

**How to apply:** Canonicalize both sides with `realpathSync.native` before comparing filesystem paths from different sources.
