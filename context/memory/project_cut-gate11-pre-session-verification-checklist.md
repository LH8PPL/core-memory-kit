16-point checklist run before Session 1:
- G1: install + doctor (expect 5 pass, 0 fail, 3 skip)
- G7: semantic search ENABLED, hybrid default
- HC-8: npm-12 binding healthy
- G2/G2b: memory write/search skills use safe tools only
- G3: CLAUDE.md points to cmk remember
- G4: scaffold cleanliness (no TODOs, placeholders, usernames)
- settings.json: hooks + mcp + cmk allow-list wired correctly
- .gitignore and git staging verified (no accidental leaks)

**Why:** Documents baseline scaffold state; confirms readiness before building; catches misconfiguration early

**How to apply:** Re-run checklist at session start on similar projects to verify no drift
