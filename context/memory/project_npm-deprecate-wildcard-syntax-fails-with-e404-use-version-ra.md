Using bare wildcard syntax (`npm deprecate @package@*`) results in E404 "Not Found" errors and does not persist the deprecation. Use explicit version range syntax instead: `npm deprecate "@package@>=0.1.0" "message"`. This successfully deprecates all published versions without E404.

**Why:** The wildcard approach failed with "Not Found" error even though the package and versions exist in the registry. The version-range syntax uses a normal ranged PUT that avoids this issue.

**How to apply:** For future package deprecations, always use `@>=X.Y.Z` (where X.Y.Z is the earliest published version) instead of bare `@*` syntax. This is more reliable across npm registry quirks.
