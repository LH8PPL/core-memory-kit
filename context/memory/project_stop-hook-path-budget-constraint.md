The transcript write happens on the Stop-hook path with a ~500ms budget. This constrains design choices for the transcript screen implementation.

**Why:** Understanding this budget is critical to choosing between fast local methods (PII regexes) vs async approaches.

**How to apply:** When designing the transcript screening, check this budget and evaluate options against it.
