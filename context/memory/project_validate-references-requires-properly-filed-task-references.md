The `validate-references` workflow validator fails if a task ID (e.g., "Task 202") is referenced in docs/commits but not formally filed in the project task system. During v0.4.5 cut, main turned red because D-281 cut-gate log referenced Task 202 without it being formally filed.

**Why:** Ensures all task references are traceable; caught a dangling reference during release

**How to apply:** When referencing a task in work, file it first; don't do work informally and reference it later
