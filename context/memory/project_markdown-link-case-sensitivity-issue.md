Broken markdown link in CLAUDE.md involving `.claude/` paths (Linux case-sensitivity issue). Fixed in commit fd349b5 (docs-only change).

**Why:** Linux CI runners enforce case-sensitive path matching, unlike Windows. Documentation links must match actual path case.

**How to apply:** When editing CLAUDE.md with file links, verify they work on case-sensitive systems or test on CI before merging.
