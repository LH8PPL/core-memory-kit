uninstallKiro leaves empty husk files: .kiro/steering/cmk.md (dead frontmatter), .kiro/settings/mcp.json ({}), and an empty AGENTS.md — it strips our managed content but doesn't remove a now-empty file the kit created. Minor; uninstall is conservative-correct, just messy. Follow-up: remove a kit-created file when uninstall empties it (mirror pruneEmptyParent), only when no user content remains outside our markers.

**Why:** Found dogfooding cmk uninstall --ide kiro on the dev repo (D-189). Empty husks are ugly and could confuse a user into thinking uninstall failed.

**How to apply:** In uninstallKiro: after removeManagedBlock/removeJsonKey, if the resulting file is empty (or only-frontmatter / {}), and the kit created it, delete it. Guard: never delete a file with user content outside our markers.
