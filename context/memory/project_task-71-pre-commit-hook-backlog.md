Task 71 is a pre-commit hook re-screening `context/` through Poison_Guard. Currently in backlog with "wait for an incident" trigger, but manual screening recurs at every task boundary (not automated). Related to a recent data-point recorded in Task 71 entry (commit cb506c3).

**Why:** Poison_Guard screens facts at write time, but the commit-boundary screen is hand-rolled; automating this would reduce recurring manual work

**How to apply:** Treat this as evidence the trigger is warmer than passive; consider prioritizing if dogfood flushes become more frequent
