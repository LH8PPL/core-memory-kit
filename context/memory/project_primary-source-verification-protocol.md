Before asserting that a task is complete or correct, or diagnosing whether behavior is a bug, verify against primary sources: code (with line numbers), task spec (exact deliverable match), and design intent. Assertions without this verification are provisional. The project refers to this principle as "did you check the primary source?"

**Why:** Intuition without source verification is unreliable; primary sources are ground truth. Prevents confident-but-wrong assessments.

**How to apply:** When evaluating task/feature status, check primary sources FIRST. Only after verification, assert conclusions.
