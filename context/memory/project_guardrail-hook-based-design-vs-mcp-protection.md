The delete-guardrail is implemented as a `preToolUse` hook behavior (not an MCP tool).
- Distinct from MCP's `mk_forget` (two-step confirm for destructive ops in the MCP interface)
- Both protect against deletion, but at different layers

**Why:** Readers and future maintainers may conflate the two protections. Clarity on implementation and scope prevents confusion about which layer is responsible for what.

**How to apply:** Document the guardrail in hook-related docs (e.g., Security section, README hook-behavior subsection). Keep `mk_forget` documented in MCP.md. In code comments or docs, refer to them as distinct mechanisms when explaining deletion protection.
