Core privacy/integrity contract: the agent (via MCP or auto-call surfaces) must never be able to access a fact that was explicitly forgotten (`cmk forget`). Enforced by: `includeTombstoned` flag defaults to false (opt-in only), MCP surfaces never pass this flag, CLI-only `cmk get --include-tombstoned` exposes recovery.

**Why:** Agent leaking recovered forgotten facts would be a critical privacy breach; the invariant must be enforced by-default, not remembered.

**How to apply:** Any feature reading archive/tombstones directory must verify D-163 is respected; use contract-lock test pattern — assert the body never appears in agent-facing response text, not just that "error returned."
