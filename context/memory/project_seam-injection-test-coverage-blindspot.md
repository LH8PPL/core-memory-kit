Seam-injected tests (mocking/stubbing dependencies) pass integration tests but don't execute all branches of new function bodies. Sonar's 0%-new-coverage gate detects this: new functions appear untested in coverage reports despite passing tests. Workaround: Add no-seam tests directly exercising new functions without mocks, targeting all branch paths.

**Why:** Known pattern (documented in Task-85). Prevents undetected untested code from merging.

**How to apply:** When Sonar flags new-code coverage gaps, add targeted no-seam unit tests. Use Sonar API to identify exact uncovered lines, add tests covering each, verify locally.
