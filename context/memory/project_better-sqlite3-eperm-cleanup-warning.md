During `npm install -g` of claude-memory-kit, npm cleanup fails on better_sqlite3.node with EPERM (operation not permitted), but the package installation continues successfully. Full output: warns about inability to unlink `better_sqlite3.node`, then completes with "added 4 packages, and changed 137 packages."

**Why:** This warning is expected/ignorable—failure during cleanup doesn't mean the build or installation failed. Knowing this prevents unnecessary troubleshooting or reinstallation attempts in future testing cycles.

**How to apply:** When installing claude-memory-kit updates globally, expect this EPERM warning. Treat it as non-fatal; verify the install succeeded by running `cmk --version`.
