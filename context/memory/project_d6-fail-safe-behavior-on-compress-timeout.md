When SessionStart compression times out: now.md is preserved (not corrupted), the failure logs cleanly (`success: false, haiku_timeout`), and retry happens on next SessionStart. Nothing is lost or broken.

**Why:** D6 gate failure is acceptable because the kit does not corrupt or lose state; it degrades gracefully.

**How to apply:** Treat D6 timeout as a yellow flag, not a blocker. The fail-safe means the kit recovers automatically.
