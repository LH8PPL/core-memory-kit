- Taint analysis is configured via Quality Profiles (sidebar → Quality Profiles → copy "Sonar way" → deactivate S51xx security rules)
- **Critical limitation:** crashes occur in the taint-engine *context collector* phase (runs during project analysis), not during rule evaluation
- Disabling rules in Quality Profiles won't prevent the context collector from running; the crash persists regardless
- Per SonarSource staff: taint-*engine* crashes (not rule-firing issues) require vendor support; disabling rules is not a workaround

**Why:** SonarSource documentation + community precedent confirm this is a known limitation; prevents time wasted on configuration-based workarounds for engine-level problems

**How to apply:** If SonarCloud taint analysis crashes, recognize it as a taint-engine issue requiring vendor support, not a user-configurable toggle — don't pursue the Quality Profile route
