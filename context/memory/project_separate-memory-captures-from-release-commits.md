Keep memory/capture commits (context/ changes, session logs, hook captures) in a separate commit from release commits (CHANGELOG.md, package.json version bumps). Release commits contain only the version-bump content, preserving clean audit trail.

**Why:** Release commits should show only what went into the release — when auditing `release: vX.Y.Z` later, the commit should be uncluttered and reviewable as a pure version bump. Accumulated memory captures muddy that history.

**How to apply:** Create two sequential commits during release: first "memory: session captures (...)", then "release: vX.Y.Z"; then push both.
