- **Committed tier:** MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, INDEX.md in `context/` — travels with `git clone`
- **Local tier (excluded from git):** `context.local/`, `context/.index/`, `context/.locks/`, transcript temp buffer
- **Temporary tier (excluded):** Raw logs (*.extract.log), machine-specific state
- **Design principle:** H1/T2 portability tenet — only committed tier is shared; local and temp never travel with code

**Why:** Enables safe sharing of scaffold and memory across machines without leaking per-machine artifacts or raw logs

**How to apply:** Apply this structure to similar projects; configure .gitignore to exclude local and temp tiers
