The repo has been burned by hook latency composition in hot paths six prior times. Hooks invoked on the critical path (like the FTS5 hint lookup before every prompt) become a measurable bottleneck.

**Why:** Hooks can add significant latency. When called synchronously on high-frequency paths, they compound—not just in aggregate, but in tail latencies and p99 impact.

**How to apply:** Audit any hook calls proposed for hot paths in Task 233 (e.g., hint retrieval). Measure empirically. Prefer batching, deferral, or elimination over synchronous hook invocation on critical paths. If hooks are unavoidable, set latency budgets and alarms.
