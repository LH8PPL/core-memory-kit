**Goal**: Systematic sweep across ~70 cross-agent projects to understand how they invoke LLMs in automated/headless contexts.

**Target Research Question**:
When a project needs an LLM in automated/headless context, does it (a) require per-agent CLI, (b) call cloud API with key, (c) invoke agent's own headless mode, or (d) something else—and how does it handle Windows specifically?

**Scope**: Multi-agent installers (claude-mem, Taskmaster, mimir, memex, EverOS) as entry points; expanding to ~70 projects across Windows/Mac/Linux.

**Pending Decision**: Execution method—
- Option 1: Workflow/fan-out (parallel, higher token cost)
- Option 2: Sequential/methodical (cheaper, starting with multi-agent tools)

**Why:** The target question is the evaluation rubric for all 70 projects. Persisting it ensures consistent, repeatable research across resumptions and prevents re-deriving scope.

**How to apply:** When D-271 resumes, reference this target question as the evaluation standard for each project. Apply the chosen execution method consistently.
