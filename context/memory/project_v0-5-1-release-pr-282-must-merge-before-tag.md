PR #282 (Task 222 install-prompt fix) must merge to main before tagging v0.5.1. State after merge: code on main, docs updated (cut-gate, CHANGELOG, QUICKSTART, RELEASE-PLAN, build-log, DECISION-LOG, tasks), release commit (a97a485) staged. Final step: `git tag v0.5.1 && git push origin v0.5.1` (user-initiated).

**Why:** Ensures v0.5.1 release artifact includes the Task 222 fix (without merge, tag would ship older build)

**How to apply:** When ready to release, confirm #282 merged, then run tag steps
