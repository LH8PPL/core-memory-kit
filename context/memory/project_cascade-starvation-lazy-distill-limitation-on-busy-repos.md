The `detectStaleness` verdict cascade returns only the highest-precedence verdict per cycle. On busy repos (where now.md keeps refilling each session), verdict is stuck at `stale-now`, blocking lower-precedence verdicts (`stale-daily`, `stale-weekly`) from triggering. This prevents multi-level compression refresh cycles, causing recent.md to silently go stale over days.

**Why:** Known limitation (Task 105/D-75). Surfaces as unexpected staleness on high-activity projects. Lazy SessionStart fallback is insufficient as *sole* distill mechanism for hierarchical compression.

**How to apply:** Best fix: register cron for scheduled background distill. Document the limitation clearly. Consider improving detectStaleness to permit lower verdicts in parallel, or file as formal bug for future resolution.
