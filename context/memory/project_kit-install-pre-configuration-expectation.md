After `cmk install` completes, the memory-write skill should be added to Claude Code's allow-list automatically. Users should never see a permission prompt for pre-authorized kit skills. A prompt appearing indicates either: (a) the allow-list wasn't properly written during install, or (b) an external factor (Claude Code version/bug) broke the configuration.

**Why:** The kit's design contract is zero-friction setup — once installed, tools work without friction. Prompts after install violate this and signal a broken install or incompatibility.

**How to apply:** On diagnosis, verify allow-list was written to the correct location during `cmk install`. If allow-list is correct but prompts still appear, check Claude Code version against issue #14956 (Skill() + allowed-tools composition bug).
