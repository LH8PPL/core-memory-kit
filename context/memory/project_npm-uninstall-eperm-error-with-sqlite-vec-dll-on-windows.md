During `npm uninstall -g`, cleanup may fail with EPERM on the sqlite-vec-windows-x64\vec0.dll binary if a process (Claude Code IDE, MCP server, or other tools) still holds the file handle.

Error:
```
npm warn cleanup Failed to remove some directories [
  [
    'C:\\Users\\...\\node_modules\\@lh8ppl\\.claude-memory-kit-...',
    [Error: EPERM: operation not permitted, unlink '...\\vec0.dll']
  ]
]
```

**Why:** Native bindings (`.dll` files) on Windows remain locked if any process has loaded them. npm cannot unlink a locked file.

**How to apply:** If uninstall fails with EPERM, close any IDEs, Claude Code instances, or MCP sessions that may have loaded the package, then retry `npm uninstall -g`. The uninstall may partially succeed (137 packages removed) even with warnings.
