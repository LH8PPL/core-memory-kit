Features that mutate host system state (F-6 register-crons, F-13 import real Auto Memory, F-14 long-running server, F-15 full history scan, F-19 destructive uninstall) are deliberately not auto-run during verification sweeps. They are listed explicitly and require per-item user sign-off before execution.

**Why:** Protects the user's real system and data from unintended side effects during automated testing.

**How to apply:** When running verification sweeps, clearly mark system-touching operations as "deliberately skipped," list them separately, and ask the user which (if any) they want to run next. Do not presume to execute destructive or system-mutating operations.
