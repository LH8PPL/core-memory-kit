**Design** (reconnaissance complete, implementation blocked on PR #280):
- Install: fold duplicates into single refreshed block (self-healing per D-169 posture)
- Uninstall: remove ALL blocks
- Preserve user bytes between blocks
- Detect duplicates: surface `duplicateCount` via `findManagedBlock` for HC-9 flagging

**Implementation scope**:
- `claude-md.mjs`: first-match in `findManagedBlock`
- `install-agent.mjs`: non-global `String.replace`

**Sequencing**: Task 220 branches off fresh main only after PR #280 CI passes

**Why:** D-169 self-healing posture; HC-9 needs duplicate visibility; strict sequencing prevents race conditions

**How to apply:** Once PR #280 merges, implement per design spec; do not open Task 220 implementation branch until PR #280 is live
