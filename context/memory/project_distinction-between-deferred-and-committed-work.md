- "Might be useful someday" → use D-248 discipline (named triggers, gate-checked when condition fires)
- "Breaks the kit's central promise" → committed lane + version (immediate fix, not deferred)
- Example: distill starvation with false-positive health check is the latter

**Why:** Conflating the two led to premature deferral; silent promise-breaking should not be gated.

**How to apply:** When filing a bug/issue, ask: does this break a core guarantee? If yes, commit to a version/lane immediately. If no, consider a trigger-gated task.
