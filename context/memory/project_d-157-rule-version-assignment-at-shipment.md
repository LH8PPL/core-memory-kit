Version digits are assigned when tasks ship, not before. Pre-assigning versions to unshipped or deferred tasks violates this rule. Example: assigning 184 to v0.5 before the design decision is made is incorrect; tail tasks get their version number when cut, not in advance.

**Why:** Pre-numbering creates false structure that misrepresents development reality and can lead to incorrect release planning.

**How to apply:** When planning a release, assign versions only to tasks that are actually shipping. Tasks in design/curation phases or deferred work should have no pre-assigned version; they receive one when they're ready to ship.
