A passing CI/CD workflow does NOT guarantee a passing commit. Documented in CLAUDE.md sub-rule (d). Check-runs enumerate the true commit status; workflows can pass while checks fail.

**Why:** Prevents false confidence in build/deploy readiness; assistant initially relied on workflows and missed commit-level failures.

**How to apply:** When verifying pass/fail on a branch, explicitly enumerate check-runs. Don't assume workflow green = commit green.
