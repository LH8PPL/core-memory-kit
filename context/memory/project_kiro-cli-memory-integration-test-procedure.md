Rebuild and live-test from branch:
- `npm pack` from `packages/cli/`; uninstall and reinstall globally
- `cmk install --with-semantic --ide kiro` in fresh folder
- Test via interactive `kiro-cli`; type a fact

**Expected outcome:** agent runs `cmk remember "..."` (shell CLI) — NOT `mk_remember` tool
**Success criteria:** fact lands in `context/MEMORY.md`

**Why:** Kiro bug #5873 blocks explicit tool route; CLI route is workaround. Live test confirms full integration before merge.

**How to apply:** Run this flow when validating kiro-cli memory capture. Paste the response to verify `cmk remember` is invoked and facts are saved.
