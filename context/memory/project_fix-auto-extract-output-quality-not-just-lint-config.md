**Option (b): Fix the source** — improve auto-extract to emit lint-clean markdown by construction (4-space sublists, auto-linked URLs instead of bare URLs). This eliminates the root cause (prose formatting rules don't fire on clean output).

**Rationale:** (b) attacks the cause, not the symptom. (a) config relaxation is the safety net for edge cases. The strongest approach is **both**: clean output by construction + scoped `.markdownlint.json` for robustness.

**Why:** The memory files don't fail because of the kit format; they fail because auto-extract prose is unpolished. Fixing the tool's output quality is more principled than configuring away linter rules.

**How to apply:** Prioritize improving auto-extract output quality; use scoped config as a safety net, not the primary fix.
