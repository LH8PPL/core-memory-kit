- PR #219 squash-merged at `96f57c9`; both self-review and `code-review-excellence` skill review completed
- The skill's I1 (Important) decision: made trust-leg non-fatal when `.vscode/settings.json` is corrupt
- Branch deleted; D-194 complete; main up to date and clean
- The artifact currently in `C:\Temp\kiro-gate` is pre-fix; must be rebuilt to test KH-trust live

**Why:** This fix resolves the Run/Reject blocker. Live verification (KH-trust) requires the new code on disk, not the old artifact.

**How to apply:** Before continuing: `cd C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit\packages\cli && npm pack && npm install -g ./lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-0.4.0.tgz`, then `cd C:\Temp\kiro-gate && cmk install --with-semantic --ide kiro` to add KG11 + new `.vscode` trust surface, restart Kiro, verify Run/Reject prompt is gone.
