Always create a NEW backup directory for each cut-gate / backup run — never overwrite or reuse an existing backup dir, even if it has the same gate name. Use a unique suffix (timestamp or run-N) so prior backups stay intact as evidence.

**Why:** An existing backup dir from an earlier run holds the only verbatim copy of the real ~/.claude-memory-kit and ~/.aws state from that run; overwriting it destroys that evidence and could lose the original if a later restore goes wrong.

**How to apply:** Before any backup, check if the target dir exists; if it does, create a sibling with a unique suffix (e.g. _run2, or a timestamp passed in). Never Move/Copy into a pre-existing backup dir.
