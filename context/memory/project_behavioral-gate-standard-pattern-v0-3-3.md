All behavioral gates must follow a consistent, executable shape:
- **Copy-paste prompt**: exact user text to paste into Claude Code
- **Explicit PASS**: what tool Claude should invoke + what the answer must contain (e.g., "mk_search with scope:decisions" + shows retracted decision)
- **Explicit FAIL**: blocker condition with name + rationale (e.g., "recall directive not triggering" means the gate fails)

Examples:
- M0-M3 gates (conversational MCP, recall ladder): already concrete
- DJ4-live, F-7b-live: retrofitted to this pattern in this session

**Why:** Vague gates ("ask a history question") are not executable by humans running manual pre-release verification. Every gate must be runnable by someone without deep project context.

**How to apply:** At gate review time, validate all three parts (prompt, PASS, FAIL) are concrete. New gates should be drafted with all three parts from the start.
