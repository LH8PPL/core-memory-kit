Autonomous memories verify across sessions:
- Write memory + register PREDICTION (this session)
- Tool resolves prediction (HIT/MISS/REVERSAL)
- Memory is recalled next session; outcome feeds back (silent help or dampening)

Stop-hook JUDGE (Task 192) closes within-session failures. Task 194 (v0.5.1) wires cross-session dampening into recall ranking.

**Why:** Cross-session model is the design intent (ADR-0017), not a fallback—it matches how knowledge validates in practice.

**How to apply:** Plan autonomous workflows expecting delayed verification. Use PREDICTION: lines for testable expectations; let next session's recall-and-outcome confirm.
