Three explicit levels:
- **Live-tested**: real binary against real repo data (e.g., `cmk search` against actual journal)
- **Unit-tested (synthetic)**: test suite with hand-written fixtures (no real data)
- **Untested (behavioral)**: not yet run in real context (e.g., MCP in real Claude session)

**Why:** Prevents false claims of completeness. Unverified paths are flagged for cut-gate review.

**How to apply:** Specify testing level when claiming "it works." Flag gaps rather than hiding them.
