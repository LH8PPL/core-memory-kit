Three surfaces implement v0.4.0 with distinct trust mechanisms:
- **Claude Code** — settings.json hooks
- **Kiro IDE 1.0 (1.0.52)** — per-workspace permissions.yaml (ref 50.N.5, prompt-free on skill load)
- **kiro-cli V3 (2.9.0)** — agent-config allowedCommands (ref D-199, prompt-free shell capture)

All operate the full memory loop (inject → capture → observe → explicit save → cross-project wedge) **prompt-free**, with no cmd.exe popups.

**Why:** v0.4.0 unifies memory behavior across three implementations. Live testing confirmed they work in isolation without conflicts. An implicit assumption (that kiro-cli would use the same mechanism as Kiro IDE) was caught by testing.

**How to apply:** When extending v0.4.0 or adding new surfaces, validate against all three. Document each surface's trust chain separately; they are not interchangeable.
