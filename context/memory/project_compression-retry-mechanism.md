Compression rolls retry only at SessionStart (via `detectStaleness` hook), not mid-session. The 120s cooldown marker is set only on *success*, so failed compressions do not block the next retry attempt. Failed runs preserve input (now.md stays intact) for retry at the next SessionStart.

**Why:** If compression times out, the feature fails safely but silently — input is not lost. However, if failures are consistent (e.g., due to persistent CLI latency), now.md accumulates unbounded across sessions until a compression finally beats the timeout clock.

**How to apply:** When troubleshooting compression timeouts, look for `detectStaleness` / `stale-now` triggers in SessionStart logs. If timeouts repeat, expect now.md growth across sessions; recovery depends on `claude --print` latency improving.
