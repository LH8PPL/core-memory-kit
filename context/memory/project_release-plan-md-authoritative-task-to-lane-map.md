RELEASE-PLAN.md is the single source of truth for assigning tasks to versions and lanes. The tasks.md file may include lane tags for reference, but these are not authoritative. **Binding rule:** every task must be assigned in RELEASE-PLAN.md at the same time it receives a lane tag in tasks.md. Any task with a lane in tasks.md but missing from RELEASE-PLAN.md is a dangling reference and must be fixed in RELEASE-PLAN.md.

**Why:** Prevents silent orphans. A task could appear laned in tasks.md but actually lack a version assignment, causing confusion about scope and release timing.

**How to apply:** After adding laned tasks to tasks.md, immediately add them to RELEASE-PLAN.md. Periodically audit by comparing both files — look for tasks in tasks.md that lack entries in RELEASE-PLAN.md. Run validators (references, numbering-gaps) to catch inconsistencies.
