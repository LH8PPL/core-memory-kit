SESSION STATE at pause (2026-07-20, pre-compact): v0.6.0 SHIPPED - published to npm @lh8ppl/core-memory-kit@0.6.0 with provenance + GitHub Release, installed globally and on this repo (doctor 12 PASS / 0 FAIL). Task 174 (git-history backfill) merged to main, 3238/3238 green, CI green. D-374 prior-art sweep done. NEXT: v0.6.1 remaining = Task 235 (PreCompact capture) + Task 236 (count gate). Then v0.6.2 = 240 + 241 + 237. Then v0.7.0 = Task 95 + rider 189. Nothing is in flight; tree is clean and pushed.

**Why:** The session paused at 10 percent context before auto-compact. A post-compact session needs the resumption point without re-deriving it from git log or tasks.md.

**How to apply:** Resume by reading this fact, then specs/tasks.md for 235 and 236. BEFORE building tasks 67, 146, 177, 184 or 223, read the prior-art annotations now written into their tasks.md entries (D-374) - two of them may change the design, especially 184 (basic-memory already solved multi-project navigation) and 67 (a 9-system survey says the --cross-project flag lean is the field's rejected minority approach).
