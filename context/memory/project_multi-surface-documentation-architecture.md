The project maintains coordinated documentation across ~10 surfaces:
- **Top-level:** README.md, CHANGELOG, DECISION-LOG, HEALTH-CHECKS.md, RESUME-HERE.md
- **Package docs:** packages/cli/README.md
- **Detailed guides:** docs/ (CLI.md, MCP.md, process/cut-gate-kiro.md)
- **Specifications:** specs/ (design.md, tasks.md)

During releases, all surfaces are updated and synchronized. Validators (checking references, doc-completeness, index accuracy) are run to ensure consistency.

**Why:** The tool supports multiple agents (Claude Code, Kiro IDE, kiro-cli), so docs must span multiple entry points and use cases. Validators prevent drift as the codebase evolves.

**How to apply:** When shipping a release, plan to touch all ~10 surfaces. After updates, run the validator suite. Treat doc sync as part of release QA.
