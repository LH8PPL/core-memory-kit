The release cut-gate (manual verification step, cut-guide §0b onward) uses four named probes:
- FQ1
- DJ1
- DJ2
- DJ3

All verified and current for v0.3.2.

**Why:** These probes verify the built artifact before publishing. Knowing their names helps locate them in the release guide.

**How to apply:** When running the cut-gate (step 2), execute each probe as specified in the guide and confirm all pass before tag-pushing.
