- Kit memory entry "bench-storage allowlist must NOT be emptied" became stale after Node 22 floor bump
- Updated via `cmk remember` (core-memory-kit's built-in command)
- Tombstoned entries prevent future resurrection of outdated rules
- Recorded in D-387

**Why:** Stale memory can block justified changes. Tombstoning marks entries as superseded and stops them being restored from old snapshots.

**How to apply:** When a project fact is contradicted by new setup, use `cmk remember` to tombstone. Creates audit trail and prevents stale rules from re-activating.
