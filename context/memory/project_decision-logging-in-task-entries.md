Record key design decisions and their downstream implications in task entries. Example: task 151.6 noted that consuming the newly-added `trust_score` field is deferred until tasks 151.7/151.8, which triggers a re-eval of 151.5's design — this cross-task dependency was written into the task entry so it isn't lost.

**Why:** Preserves reasoning across sessions; prevents re-deriving the same design decision or losing dependency chains that feed into later work.

**How to apply:** When a decision has downstream effects, write it into the task entry explicitly. Use the decision log to capture triggers and rationale.
