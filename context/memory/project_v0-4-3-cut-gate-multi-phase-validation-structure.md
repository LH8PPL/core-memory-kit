Release validation has these sequential phases:
  - **§0-1 Scaffold:** G0-G7 checks — version match, install, doctor, skills, semantic, file safety, MCP
  - **§2 Session 1 Capture:** Collect 18 rich facts, verify explicit-vs-inferred classification
  - **§3 Capture Validation:** B3-B7 — wedge fills, graduation fire (reactive + proactive)
  - **§4 Explicit Checks:** C1-C6 + FQ1 — Poison_Guard (API key rejection), home-path sanitization, Unicode safety, FTS5 robustness
  - **§4d Persona Headline:** PR1-PR5 — recurrence bump, demote-not-evict (Hole B), trust_score migration, topic-routing (Hole C), invisible-Unicode block
  - **Sessions 2-3:** Live user-driven validation (W1-W4 recall quality, brand-new-project cold-open test)
  - **Final Steps:** LLM-driven persona promotion via `cmk persona generate`, README/CHANGELOG/version verification, `v0.4.3` tag + publish

**Why:** This structured workflow ensures v0.4.3 passes both deterministic safety checks and live-session recall quality before release.

**How to apply:** Reference this when running future cuts; sections 0-4 are automatable and runnable in any environment, but Sessions 2-3 and final steps require live user interaction and cannot be scripted.
