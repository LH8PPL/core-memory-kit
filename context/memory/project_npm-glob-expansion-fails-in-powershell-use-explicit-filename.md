On Windows PowerShell, `npm install -g .\pattern-*.tgz` fails with ENOENT because npm does not expand glob patterns. PowerShell passes the literal string `.\lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-*.tgz` to npm instead of the resolved filename.

**Workaround:** Use the explicit filename instead:
```powershell
npm install -g ./lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-0.4.1.tgz
```

**Why:** This is a fundamental difference between PowerShell (which does not auto-expand globs in command arguments) and bash (which does). npm relies on the shell to expand patterns, so it receives the literal string and cannot find the file.

**How to apply:** In release scripts or CI that targets Windows, always use explicit filenames for npm install -g, or wrap the glob in a more portable pattern (e.g., using Node's glob module or a loop).
