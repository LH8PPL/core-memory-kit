The git tag and push (`git tag v0.4.1 && git push origin HEAD --tags`) happens as the **final** step, only **after** all gates pass. This tag triggers `publish.yml` (npm + GitHub Release), so gates serve as the guard before publishing.

**Why:** Prevents publishing to npm/GitHub until all gates confirm the artifact is sound. Provides a natural rollback point (do not tag if gates fail).

**How to apply:** Follow this order: release → commit (local) → pack/install → backup → scaffold → **run gates** → **only then: tag & push**. Do not tag immediately after release.
