`validate-skill-sources.mjs` upgraded from naive lenient parsing to strict YAML parsing with integration tests. Catches invalid skill frontmatter (e.g., unquoted colons: "update memory: X is now Y") during validation, before Kiro deployment. The canonical validator now matches Kiro's strict parsing (PyYAML) instead of Claude Code's lenient parsing.

**Why:** Previous gap masked errors for months: Claude Code accepted invalid YAML while Kiro rejected it. This caused D-195. Strict validation upstream prevents cross-tool incompatibilities.

**How to apply:** When modifying skill validation or YAML parsing, use strict parsing (PyYAML semantics) and include integration tests that verify against both strict and lenient parsers.
