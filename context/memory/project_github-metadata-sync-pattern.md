Multiple metadata surfaces track the same configuration facts:
- README.md (primary source)
- CLI help/docs (reflects README)
- GitHub repo About description (must match README agents)
- GitHub Topics tags (must include active agent names like `codex`, drop deprecated IDE tags like `kiro-ide`)

These drift out of sync if updated independently.

**Why:** The Codex support shipped in v0.5.2 but GitHub About wasn't updated until this session, creating false inconsistency in public-facing metadata.

**How to apply:** Treat README as authoritative. When adding features or agents, verify all four surfaces are updated: README → code/CLI → GitHub About/Topics. Single update to one surface is incomplete.
