B5/B7 probes in release validation overwrite `settings.json` wholesale. Footgun documented in cut-gate.md v0.3.0 release notes.

**Why:** Running B5/B7 in a working directory (not throwaway) corrupts configuration.

**How to apply:** Always run B5/B7 probes in temporary/throwaway directories only. Never in shared or production-like directories.
