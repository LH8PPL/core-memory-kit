- Target research: How ~70 projects invoke LLMs headlessly (CLI, API, agent mode, per-agent CLI) across Windows/Mac/Linux
- Agent model: Sonnet 5 (not Opus 4.8) to optimize subscription costs
- Wave structure: Discovery (Wave 0) + synthesis phases, with approval gates between
- At each wave boundary: manifest + token burn report before proceeding
- User maintains explicit kill switch; no auto-advancement

**Why:** User has subscription cost constraints; batching with transparency allows controlled, budget-aware progression

**How to apply:** Launch Wave 0 on Sonnet 5. After discovery phase, report manifest + token burn. Wait for user approval before Wave 1.
