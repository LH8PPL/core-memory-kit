The project uses an "autopilot" CI/CD system that auto-merges most code PRs when CI passes. PRs that modify the user-facing install surface (e.g., node:sqlite migration, loadExtension behavior) are surfaced to the user for explicit approval rather than auto-merged.

**Why:** Future sessions need to know which changes require user approval and which proceed automatically, to avoid unintended ship-surface deployments.

**How to apply:** When planning or reviewing PRs, check if the change affects user install/setup behavior; if yes, ensure it's routed to user approval, not auto-merge.
