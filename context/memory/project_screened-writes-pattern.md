Both `write-fact` and `import-anthropic-memory` must screen `title` + `body` through Poison_Guard and home-path sanitize before committing. Prevents secrets in version control.

**Why:** Real incidents: `cmk remember --title "ghp_<token>"` wrote secrets to committed frontmatter (write-fact gap); import-anthropic-memory laundered data with zero screening.

**How to apply:** Any new committed-write path applies screenBeforeCommittedWrite before writing. Task 216 batches this across remaining unscreened sites.
