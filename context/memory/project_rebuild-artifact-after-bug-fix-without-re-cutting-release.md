When a bug fix merges into the release branch after `npm run release`, rebuild the global artifact without re-running the release steps:

**Skip §0a** (release cut) — version already 0.4.0; re-running would attempt 0.5.0 or error.

**Re-run §0b** (rebuild artifact):
- `cd C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit\packages\cli && npm pack`
- `npm uninstall -g @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit && npm install -g .\lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-0.4.0.tgz`
- Verify: `cmk --version` (still 0.4.0, now with fix)

**Skip §0c** (backup) — folder already exists; re-running would error.

**Partial §1 re-run**: Skip mkdir/git init/cmk install (already complete). Re-run only the failing check (e.g., `cmk doctor` in gate project) with the rebuilt binary.

**Why:** Global `cmk` is the pre-fix binary. Bug fixes are content-only; version stays unchanged. The binary must be re-packed and re-installed.

**How to apply:** After merge + `git pull`, execute this sequence. Then resume gate from the next checkpoint (KH1/KH2).
