- SonarCloud fails on every push with a server-side crash (vendor bug)
- Marked advisory-only: does not block CI/CD, merge, or deployments
- Tracked as D-341; vendor bug already filed; unrelated to project code changes
- Consistent, repeatable behavior

**Why:** Future sessions should recognize this as expected and harmless, not a regression or blocker

**How to apply:** If SonarCloud fails in CI with server-crash errors, check D-341 status; if it matches, safe to ignore and proceed with other gates
