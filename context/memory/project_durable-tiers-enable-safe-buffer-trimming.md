`now.md` and `today-*.md` are *derived* buffers over durable tiers. The durable record is `context/transcripts/{date}.md` (written first by capture-turn), and the tiered archive (recent.md, archive.md). Trimming old turns from derived buffers doesn't lose data — the transcript is the authoritative copy.

**Why:** When bounding input to compression, the "where does overflow go?" concern dissolves. Old content can be safely trimmed from derived buffers because it's already in the durable record.

**How to apply:** Use this insight to justify aggressive trimming of `now.md`/`today-*.md` without data-loss concern. Transcript layer is the fallback.
