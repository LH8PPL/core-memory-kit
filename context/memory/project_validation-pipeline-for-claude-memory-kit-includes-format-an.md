Pre-commit validation catches two classes of issues:
- **Format/limit validator** — catches schema violations (1024-char skill description limit)
- **Privacy validator** — blocks names/tokens from being committed (caught "liorwiki" reference)

Both validators are integrated into prerun checks and stress-test flow.

**Why:** Preventive gates catch issues before code review, reducing back-and-forth and avoiding silent failures (1024-char limit would cause skill to silently fail to load).

**How to apply:** Treat validator feedback as critical path, not optional checks — run prerun (catches privacy), verify doc limits (e.g., 1024-char spec), and stress suite before merge.
