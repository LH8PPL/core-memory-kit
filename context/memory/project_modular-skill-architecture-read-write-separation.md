The kit's two core skills are deliberately separated by capability boundary:

- `memory-search` — read-only (allowed-tools: search/get/timeline/recent only), context: fork, returns summary only
- `memory-write` — write-only (safe-write path: remember/forget/trust), never reads

This separation is intentional and foundational: a read-only recall skill that cannot mutate memory is the safety inverse of a write-only capture skill. Each loads only its own context; skill bodies do not front-load context (progressive disclosure — bodies load on demand).

**Why:** Separating read from write reduces blast radius and prevents accidental memory corruption. The boundary is a first-class design principle, not an implementation detail.

**How to apply:** When designing or extending skills, preserve this boundary. Do not merge read and write capabilities. Progressive disclosure means skill bodies should be lazy and load context on demand, not front-load it.
