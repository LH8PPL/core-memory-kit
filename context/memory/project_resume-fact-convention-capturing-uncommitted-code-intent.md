The project uses "resume facts" in the codebase memory to preserve the shape and intent of code that is not yet ready for commit.

Example: a stray test (`cli-cursor-backend.test.js`) was gated on pending deep research. Rather than commit it or discard it silently, its shape was preserved in a resume fact, then the file was removed from the working tree.

**Why:** This allows cleanup of uncommitted work without losing the design intent, making it easy for the next session to recall what was being attempted and why it was deferred.

**How to apply:** When removing uncommitted code that has lasting intent, preserve its shape and rationale in a resume fact before deletion. Reference it when that gate is lifted.
