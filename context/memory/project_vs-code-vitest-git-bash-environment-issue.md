VS Code's electron environment variables can poison vitest workers when tests are launched from Git Bash, causing spurious test failures. The same tests run clean when executed from PowerShell.

- Symptom: tests fail from Git Bash, pass from PowerShell
- Root cause: VS Code's electron env vars leak into test process
- Workaround: run tests from PowerShell instead

**Why:** Environment-specific issue that causes hard-to-diagnose test flakes; explicitly surfaced as worth documenting to prevent future re-diagnosis sessions

**How to apply:** When tests fail unexpectedly (especially from Git Bash in VS Code), try running from PowerShell to confirm/rule out this issue
