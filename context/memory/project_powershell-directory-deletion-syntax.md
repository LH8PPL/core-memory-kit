PowerShell's `rm` is an alias for `Remove-Item` and does NOT accept bash-style flags.

- **Command to delete:** `Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "path"`
- **Command to verify:** `Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Directory -Filter context packages | Select-Object FullName`
  - Returns nothing (or "not found") if directories are gone

**Why:** User's primary shell is PowerShell on Windows; bash syntax like `rm -rf` causes ParameterBindingException errors.

**How to apply:** Emit PowerShell-correct commands in hand-typed instructions for this project. Always test locally before providing as paste-ready one-liners.
