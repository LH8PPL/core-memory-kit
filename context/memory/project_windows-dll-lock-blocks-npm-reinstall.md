On Windows, native binding DLLs (e.g., sqlite) are locked by running processes (e.g., MCP servers). This prevents npm install/reinstall, causing EBUSY errors. Workaround: stop all MCP server processes before reinstalling. They will reconnect automatically on the next tool call.

**Why:** Windows locks in-use files; npm cannot replace them while processes hold them.

**How to apply:** Before npm reinstall on Windows, kill MCP servers. They auto-reconnect on next tool invocation.
