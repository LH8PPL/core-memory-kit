During testing, cmk agent showed `allowedTools: MISSING` where prior setup (D-196) specifies `["@cmk"]`. If genuinely missing, MCP calls would prompt even when cmk is active.

**Why:** cmk is intended to be the auto-approve agent, but missing `allowedTools` in its config would prevent MCP auto-approval. This is a configuration regression.

**How to apply:** Before shipping, verify cmk agent config file contains `"allowedTools": ["@cmk"]`. If missing, restore per D-196.
