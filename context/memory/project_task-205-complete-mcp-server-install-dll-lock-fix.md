Fixed `cmk install` breaking when targeting its own running MCP server. Work completed:
- Diagnosis: bin boundary constraint + dependency-free recovery module
- Testing: unit tests + live-spawn probe against real running server
- Live-probe discovery: matcher missed real quoted command line (`"mcp" "serve"`) — third real-payload instance
- Genuine captured payload committed as test fixture
- Skill review found gap: PIDs without command lines allowed blind kill consent
- Both issues fixed and tested before gate run
- Awaiting test suite + stress report results before PR commit

**Why:** Live probes caught payload issue unit tests missed; skill review caught consent-flow gap; demonstrates effectiveness of multi-layer validation before merge

**How to apply:** Apply live-probe testing for MCP-related work in Task 206+; use captured real payloads as test fixtures; validate consent flows in skill review
