Git history is the only evidence available for reconstructing missing gap days (days with no harness session). Generalizing to other sources would require building for an impossible case — a day with evidence other than git is not a gap, so it already has a real record.

**Why:** This constrains design decisions. The feature isn't "pluggable evidence sources" but "git-only reconstruction for gaps". Trying to generalize would add complexity for zero benefit.

**How to apply:** When evaluating enhancements to Task 174 or similar backfill logic, remember gaps are gaps precisely because other evidence doesn't exist. Don't add multi-source adapters; keep it simple and git-focused.
