- **Decision**: Ship v0.1.0 under `@lh8ppl` scope; defer cross-agent product name to v0.2.
- **Trigger condition**: Cross-agent support shipping (rename to umbrella name or keep `claude-memory-kit` as adapter).
- **Status (2026-06-28)**: Trigger has fired — Kiro shipped in v0.4.
- **Two paths**: (a) umbrella rename to agent-neutral name (`agent-memory-kit`, `mnemo`, `recall`); (b) keep `claude-memory-kit` as Claude-Code adapter.
- **Invariant**: `cmk` CLI command survives either path.
- **Name collision**: awrshift/claude-memory-kit exists (Python product) — adds urgency but doesn't change decision.

**Why:** Rename deliberately deferred while design matured. Trigger condition is now live; next major release is the natural rebranding moment.

**How to apply:** When planning next major-version release, reference ADR-0012 and choose between paths. Collision adds timeline pressure.
