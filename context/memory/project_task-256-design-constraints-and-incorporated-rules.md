Design constraints (established by lead):
- Capped star with linear cost (addresses objection from Task 232)
- Noise guards for single-citer and stopword-grade anchors
- `cmk links D-361` capability — enables "what cites this decision" queries

Incorporated rules from prior tasks this week:
- Fixture-write ban (from Task 254 incident)
- PowerShell-only test rule
- D-293 semantic-reindex ban
- Code-fence stripping reuse
- Byte-stability determinism rules

**Why:** Constraints guide implementation decisions. Rules embody lessons learned this week and prevent regression to prior incidents.

**How to apply:** Reference when reviewing Task 256 code; apply the same rule patterns to subsequent tasks.
