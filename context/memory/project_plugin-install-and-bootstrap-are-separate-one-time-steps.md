`/plugin install` provides the global machinery (hooks + skills) once per Claude Code instance. `bootstrap` scaffolds the per-project memory files (`context/` directory) once per project. These are distinct architectural concerns (verified in ADR-0005 + bootstrap skill docs). The plugin-path equivalent of `cmk install` (npm) is the two-step dance: npm install + per-project bootstrap.

**Why:** Clarifies why two commands are required and prevents confusion about whether bootstrap is redundant or a plugin issue.

**How to apply:** Document both as distinct required steps in the README/QUICKSTART. Emphasize that either path (npm or plugin) requires both machinery setup AND per-project scaffolding.
