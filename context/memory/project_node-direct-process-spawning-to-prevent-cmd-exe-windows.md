Established pattern (Task 81, D-190) for avoiding persistent cmd.exe windows on Windows:
- Use `process.execPath` + path to `.mjs` file (instead of shim commands like `cmk`)
- Add `windowsHide: true` in spawn options
- Path resolution already available: `resolveCompressLazyPath` (uses `import.meta.url → ../bin/<x>.mjs`)

Fixes both detached-child spawns (lazy-compress) and MCP server registrations. Already applied successfully in Claude Code (both CLI and MCP).

**Why:** Cmd.exe wrappers create visible persistent windows on Windows, breaking UX—especially critical for CLI tools. Claude Code success validates the approach.

**How to apply:** When configuring process spawns or MCP commands, check for shim usage (`command: 'cmk'` style)—convert to node-direct using this pattern. Verify functionality (e.g., `mk_search` / memory) still works post-fix.
