The `agentStop` hook should fire automatically at the end of each turn. Preferences stated out loud; do not prefix utterances with "remember this" or memory commands — the hook will capture durable facts automatically.

**Why:** Core test of automation: hook must work without polluting user utterances with memory syntax

**How to apply:** Speak preferences naturally within Kiro stages; let hook fire at end-of-turn; verify capture in context\sessions\now.md (hook should have fired; facts extracted and waiting for review)
