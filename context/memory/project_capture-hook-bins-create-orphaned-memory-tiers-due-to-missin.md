All 8 capture-hook bins pass `projectRoot: process.cwd()` without:
- Root-discovery walk
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` precedence

When agent's cwd is a subdirectory, this creates an orphaned memory tier there instead of routing to project root. The project already has `resolveMcpProjectRoot` implementing the correct behavior.

**Why:** Discovered when Task-241 staging found `context/` in `packages/cli/src/` with facts accumulated since 2026-06-18, none mirrored to root tier. The gitignore-per-path approach (`gitignore:111`, 2026-06-13) only treated the symptom at one location.

**How to apply:** Point all 8 bins at existing `discoverRootUpward` resolver (v0.6.2). Add `doctor` check to detect and warn on stray `context/` dirs below root.
