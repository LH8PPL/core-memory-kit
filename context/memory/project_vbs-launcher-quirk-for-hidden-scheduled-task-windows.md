Windows scheduled task popups can be hidden by wrapping the executable in a .vbs launcher script rather than running cmd directly.
Pattern: Create a .vbs file in a gitignored directory (e.g., context/.locks/), point schtasks to the .vbs instead of the original cmd, and use VBScript to invoke the original command with hidden window flag.

**Why:** Visible cmd popups on schedule are disruptive; VBS wrapper is transparent to task logic but hides the UI.

**How to apply:** If a scheduled task shows a popup: (1) create a .vbs wrapper in context/.locks/, (2) use schtasks /change to repoint the task, (3) test via manual schtasks /run to verify both functionality and exit code.
