**What's missing:** Kit logs recalls (recall-log) and extraction outcomes (D-122 trend), but does NOT log skill invocations. Cannot measure whether 233's hint upgrade actually improves fire rate — the ADR's own success criterion.

**Compounding issue:** Any measurement must record the harness's tool-loading policy, or numbers aren't comparable (per deferred-tools finding P-DXPCKAUU).

**Why:** "Fired zero times" is anecdote, not telemetry. Can't validate a fix you can't measure.

**How to apply:** Add skill-fire logging alongside 233 implementation. Include harness tool-loading policy in telemetry context. This decouples feedback from intuition and makes before/after measurable.
