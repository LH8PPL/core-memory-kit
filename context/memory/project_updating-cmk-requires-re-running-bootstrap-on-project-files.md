Updating the global machinery (npm, plugin, or future `/plugin update`) does NOT re-scaffold existing projects' memory files. Users must re-run `bootstrap` in each project after updating to refresh the project scaffold. The plugin update path itself is currently unverified (Task 162 flags it as an open question).

**Why:** The two-step update process (global machinery + per-project scaffold) is not obvious; users will expect a single update command to handle everything and will hit stale memory files.

**How to apply:** In update docs, note that `cmk update` (or equivalent) must be followed by re-running `bootstrap` in each project. Document the npm path fully; verify and document the plugin update path (Task 162).
