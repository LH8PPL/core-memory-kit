When a decision depends on survey/validation results, write the ADR with Proposed/WIP status and mark key sections (especially Decision) as provisional pending results. This satisfies forward-reference validation while deferring the final outcome judgment. Example: ADR-0017 recorded the thesis durably with "provisional pending the survey" in its Decision section; the final decision updates after validation completes.

**Why:** Allows durable recording of the decision framework while acknowledging that conclusions are data-dependent. Also satisfies the kit's strict validator (which catches dangling references before they're created).

**How to apply:** When writing an ADR with pending validation results, use WIP/Proposed status. Mark relevant sections as provisional. Update to final status after survey/validation completes.
