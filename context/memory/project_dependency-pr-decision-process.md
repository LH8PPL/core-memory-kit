**Merge if:** CI green AND low-risk (patch/minor bumps, e.g., vitest, better-sqlite3, GitHub Actions)

**Decline if:** Major version bump with breaking changes AND no security CVE justification (e.g., js-yaml v4→v5)

**Action:** Configure Dependabot to ignore declined majors so it doesn't re-open the same PR repeatedly.

Rule: "Don't chase version currency. Security or clear value is the gate, not being current."

**Why:** Merging breaking changes for currency alone wastes time and risk. The hard gate is CI green + compelling value, not "latest version."

**How to apply:** When a major-version bump arrives, ask "CVE or compelling value?" If no, close it and configure Dependabot ignore. Don't re-triage the same decision later.
