Before testing a new global package release, back up the current user-tier memory installation to a timestamped directory (e.g., `C:\cut-gate-backups\user-tier_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss`), uninstall the old global package from npm, and install the new .tgz version from the local package directory.

**Why:** Protects user data during pre-release testing and enables rollback if issues arise.

**How to apply:** Before starting cut-gate testing, run the backup+uninstall+reinstall sequence; keep the backup until testing is complete and verified.
