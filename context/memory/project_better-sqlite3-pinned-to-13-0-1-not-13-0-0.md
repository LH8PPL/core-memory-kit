- Package: `better-sqlite3`
- Version: `^13.0.1`
- 13.0.0 contained a cross-realm bug causing vitest failures; 13.0.1 (same-day fix) resolves it

**Why:** Avoids critical vitest incompatibility in initial 13.0.0 release.

**How to apply:** Do not downgrade to 13.0.0. If vitest or cross-realm errors appear in v13 work, confirm 13.0.1+ is in use.
