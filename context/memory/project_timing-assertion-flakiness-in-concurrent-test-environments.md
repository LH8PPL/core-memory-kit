Earlier suite failure (4/5) was CPU contention from concurrent live-test + review agent running simultaneously, not a code bug. Single-isolated stress test runs avoid this collision.

**Why:** Helps future sessions distinguish environmental noise from real regressions; saves debugging time.

**How to apply:** When timing assertions fail sporadically, check CPU load & concurrent task load first; use isolated stress test (5× suite) to confirm code is sound.
