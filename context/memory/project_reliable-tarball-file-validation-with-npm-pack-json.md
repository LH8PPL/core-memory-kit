The human-readable "Tarball Contents" notice in `npm pack` output is elided by npm itself for long listings — not a kit issue.
Use `npm pack --dry-run --json` for reliable file listings; the JSON output is authoritative, the notice is not.

**Why:** Manual `tar -tzf` verification is error-prone. Structural validators need a reliable source of truth that can be asserted at test time.

**How to apply:** When validating tarball contents (e.g., ensuring all templates are bundled), use `npm pack --dry-run --json` as the input source for test-time assertions.
