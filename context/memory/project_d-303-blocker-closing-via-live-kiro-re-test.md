D-303 (gates: Cursor submission, v0.5.0 tag) requires successful live Kiro re-test.

Test criteria:
- User states a casual preference (no explicit `mk_remember` call)
- Verify `write_source: auto-extract` fact appears in captured output
- Confirms end-to-end hook→capture→memory-extraction pipeline

**Why:** Proves Kiro hook integration works in production before release gates.

**How to apply:** Execute after stress tests pass, before tagging v0.5.0 or Cursor gate submission.
