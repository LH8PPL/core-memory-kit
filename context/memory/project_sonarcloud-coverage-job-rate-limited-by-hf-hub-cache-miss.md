- **Problem**: test:coverage job in SonarCloud workflow gets rate-limited by Hugging Face Hub when run without HF-model cache, causing semantic tests to fail, vitest to abort, and lcov (coverage report) not to be written.
- **Symptom**: new_coverage metric appears as 0% even though no code regression occurred
- **Root cause**: SonarCloud was the only workflow running test:coverage without the HF-model cache (actions/cache@v5 step)
- **Fix**: Add the same actions/cache@v5 step that ci.yml already uses for other jobs

**Why:** HF Hub rate-limiting on shared API keys is a hidden failure mode in CI; without caching, coverage jobs fail silently. The fix is mechanical (copy the cache step), but the root cause is non-obvious.

**How to apply:** If coverage metrics drop to 0% with no code changes, check whether the affected CI workflow is missing the HF-model cache setup step.
