Bake `--project <project-root>` into kiro-cli's mcp.json `args` array so the project path rides in on the command line instead of env. This works because stdio `command` + `args` universally translate to `spawn(command, args)`, bypassing kiro's env-routing limitation. Expected args: `[ 'mcp', 'serve', '--project', 'C:\\path\\to\\project' ]`.

**Why:** env is not passed to stdio servers by kiro. The --project arg was proven to work in code (suite 2268/0) and is the only lever that kiro-cli cannot drop.

**How to apply:** When installing via cmk in a fresh repo, verify args were baked by reading `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`. Test by running kiro-cli, typing a memory command, and checking that facts persist to `context/`.
