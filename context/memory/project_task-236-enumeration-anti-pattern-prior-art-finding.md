ECC's catalog.js enumerates 40 doc locations for staleness checking; WORKING-CONTEXT.md is in zero of them. This caused the 4-month staleness found in D-364 study (v1.10.0 claimed 47/79/181, v2.0.0 actual 67/94/278). Design lesson: enumeration fails at the one place you didn't enumerate. Task 236 already chose generic scanning; this prior-art finding evidences that choice and rules out the auto-fix-by-location shape.

**Why:** Provides empirical justification for scanning generically rather than hand-enumerating locations.

**How to apply:** Reference when finalizing or justifying Task 236's scanning approach over enumeration.
