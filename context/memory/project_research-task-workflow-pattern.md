Research tasks (verdict-bearing work) follow this sequence:
- Research note: findings captured
- ADR: decision record
- Verdict: ADOPT/REJECT/KEEP-CURRENT decision
- One PR per task: each verdict flips to a dedicated PR (e.g., #306 for Task 178)

**Why:** Established integration pattern ensuring research findings flow through clear decision points before merge

**How to apply:** When executing research tasks, structure output and integrate following this pattern
