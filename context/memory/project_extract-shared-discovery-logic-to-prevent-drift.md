When multiple walkers implement similar logic (e.g., both walking upward for `context/`), extract the common parts into shared functions (`discoverRootUpward`, `canonicalPath`).

**Why:** Prevents the two implementations from diverging over time, which introduces subtle bugs.

**How to apply:** If a new discovery walker is added or the walk algorithm changes, ensure all walkers use the same extracted functions rather than copy-pasting.
