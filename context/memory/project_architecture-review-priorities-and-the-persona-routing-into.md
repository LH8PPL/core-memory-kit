Architecture review (2026-06-25) outcome: #1 Compaction-State module = v0.4.1 (it IS Task 167's implementation shape — build the deep module, 167.A/D/F land as its callers). #2 persona-routing seam = FOLD INTO Task 151 (v0.4.2), do NOT do standalone — 151 already rewrites PERSONA_CONFIDENCE_RULE + promoteCandidatesToUserTier wholesale, so a v0.4.1 refactor would be churn; the shared seam becomes part of 151's redesign. #3 bullet-lookup deepen = standalone low-risk, no collision. #4 (lazy-compress dispatch) folds into #1; #5 (scratchpad-sweep) deferred (one adapter = hypothetical seam).

**Why:** The /improve-codebase-architecture review found 6 deepening candidates. #2 (persona-routing) overlaps directly with Task 151's planned rewrite of the persona-promotion surface — doing it standalone in v0.4.1 would refactor code 151 rewrites in v0.4.2. The user agreed #1/#2/#3 are all worth doing but #2's timing must align with 151 to avoid churn.

**How to apply:** Build #1 as the v0.4.1 compaction-state module (= Task 167.A's last-success marker). When Task 151 does the persona redesign, extract the shared persona-routing seam (PERSONA_CONFIDENCE_RULE + parsePersonaCandidates + confidence-to-trust) as part of that rewrite, not before. #3 can ride v0.4.1 or its own patch. Re-research #4/#5 before committing.
