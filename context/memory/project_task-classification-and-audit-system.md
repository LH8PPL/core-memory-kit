All tasks are classified as one of two types:
- **Laned to a version** — assigned to a specific release (e.g., v0.6.0, v0.7.x)
- **Trigger-based** — activated when external conditions fire

An audit process ("the auditor") reviews all tasks and outputs:
- A structured table of all task classifications
- An action list with three result categories:
  - **Fired triggers** — conditions that have activated; require verdict re-evaluation
  - **Stale lanes** — version assignments requiring refresh
  - **Closure candidates** — tasks whose blockers are resolved (e.g., Task 224 after D-350 fix)

**Why:** The project uses mixed versioning and event-driven sequencing. Regular audits keep task-to-lane mappings and trigger states synchronized with reality.

**How to apply:** Use auditor output to re-verdict activated conditions, refresh outdated lane assignments, and close eligible tasks.
