- **Rule:** SessionEnd-hook compress must NOT retry
- **Conflict:** 50s retry + 50s compress = 100s total exceeds 60s ceiling under concurrent persona call
- **Delegation:** Lazy compress path (unbounded) handles retries instead
- **Safety:** Restore-on-failure pattern preserves session state until lazy compress runs

**Why:** Protect concurrent persona call latency SLA while maintaining compression safety and reliability.

**How to apply:** SessionEnd-hook fail → restore-on-failure → queue lazy compress for next session. No retry loop in hook itself.
