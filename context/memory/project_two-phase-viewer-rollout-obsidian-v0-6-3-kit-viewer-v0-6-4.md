- Phase 1 (v0.6.3): Obsidian vault integration via Task 254 — near-zero build cost, leverages Obsidian's graph/backlinks
- Phase 2 (v0.6.4): Kit's own viewer via Task 255 — design-first, kit-owned, zero dependencies, renders kit-specific concepts (trust tiers, supersession chains, doctor status, conflict queue, fire-rate collection)
- Context: Task 255 resolves D-121, a six-week parked design question; Obsidian view validates demand before larger v0.6.4 build

**Why:** Cost-benefit sequencing; tests whether users actually engage with memory before custom UI investment.

**How to apply:** Task 254 in-flight on own branch. Task 255 design grill deferred until user initiates.
