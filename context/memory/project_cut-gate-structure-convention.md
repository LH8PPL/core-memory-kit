Cut-gates have a consistent §0–§9 structure. Sections categorized as:
- **Agent-neutral sections** (capture checks, digest, persona-promotion, temporal-validity, feature sweep, portability): byte-faithful across all variants
- **Tool-specific sections** (§0b, §1, §2, §5–§7): customized per tool/platform
When creating a domain-specific gate (Cursor, Kiro, etc.), copy the full regular cut-gate.md structure, preserve agent-neutral sections exactly, and customize only the listed tool-specific sections.

**Why:** Ensures consistency, maintainability, and comprehensive coverage across all gate variants. Prevents scope creep or accidental omission of critical sections.

**How to apply:** For the next domain gate, copy cut-gate.md in full, keep agent-neutral sections unchanged, and modify only the tool-specific sections (§0b, §1, §2, §5–§7) for the new tool.
