**Claude Code** — hooks in .claude/settings.json (project-level), auto-fire, no agent concept

**Kiro CLI** — hooks in ~/.kiro/agents/<agent>/config (agent-scoped), only fire when agent active, agent-gated

**Cursor** — hooks in .cursor/hooks.json (project-level), auto-fire, no agent concept

Claude Code and Cursor sidestep agent-scoping via project-level hook files. Kiro CLI offers no project-level hook file; it forces agent-scoping everywhere.

**Why:** Explains why identical memory-kit design patterns do not work uniformly across products and forces different architectural choices per product

**How to apply:** Before implementing memory for a new Claude product, determine whether hooks are project-scoped (Code/Cursor pattern) or agent-scoped (Kiro pattern); design accordingly
