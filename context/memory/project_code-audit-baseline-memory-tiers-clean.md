Audited all `appendScratchpadBullet`, `writeFact`, `memoryWrite`, `rememberRich` callers. Searched for error/fail/timeout/health/doctor vocabulary. Result: zero hits. No module currently writes kit-status text into persistent memory tiers.

**Why:** Confirms Task 242's memory-content filter addresses a proposed risk, not an existing shipped problem. Establishes clean baseline for the kit.

**How to apply:** Future audit can check against this baseline. If kit-status text does appear in tiers later, it represents a regression.
