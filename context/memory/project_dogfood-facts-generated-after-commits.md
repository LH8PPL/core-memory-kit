The memory-kit automatically generates auto-extracted "dogfood facts" (observations about its own behavior) *after* session commits are made, by analyzing the kit's own responses and answers. These facts, plus INDEX updates, appear in a follow-up commit.

**Why:** Tool design: the kit observes and reflects on its own behavior during the session. Facts are generated from responses, so they emerge *after* the initial commit.

**How to apply:** Expect a second commit containing auto-extracted facts and INDEX updates after major session work. Include them in the final "all committed" state.
