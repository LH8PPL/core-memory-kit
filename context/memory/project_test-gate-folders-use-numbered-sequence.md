Test projects follow pattern `C:\Temp\cut-gate##`, e.g., `C:\Temp\cut-gate23` for v0.5.4 rename gate.
Increment `##` for each new gate iteration.

**Why:** Numbered sequence avoids naming collisions and makes iteration history explicit.

**How to apply:** When running a new gate, create the next number in the sequence; don't reuse or branch gate folders.
