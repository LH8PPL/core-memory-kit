Cursor's native Memories feature (introduced mid-2025) was removed in v2.1.x. Users were directed to convert memories into Rules instead. The native memory API is no longer available and docs 404.

**Impact on adapter:** No coexistence problem with built-in Cursor memory. Adapter focuses solely on its own memory injection via lifecycle hooks.

**Demand signal:** Cursor users lost native memory; demand for external memory systems (exactly what adapter provides) is now explicit.

**Why:** Architectural constraint for Task 196. Simplifies integration — no need to detect/avoid conflicts with Cursor's native memory layer. Explains user demand for the feature.

**How to apply:** In Task 196 code review, note that adapter uses only lifecycle hooks; no special handling needed for (non-existent) Cursor native memory. Validates the standalone memory injection approach.
