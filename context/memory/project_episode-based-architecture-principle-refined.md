All systems work in bounded episodes (sessions, alerts, tasks), not continuous streams. Every distinction (IDE vs agent, session vs run, autonomous vs human-steered) reduces to episode *length*. Kit abstracts over gaps and episode types, making it harness-agnostic.

Key reframing: Kit is not a memory feature bolted onto Claude Code—it is the cross-session runtime that bounded harnesses lack. For any episodic system, the kit is the only thing that lives in the gaps.

**Why:** Clarifies kit's abstraction level and applicability. Not special to Claude Code; works for any bounded-episode system (SRE, scheduled tasks, Hermes, OpenClaw, etc.).

**How to apply:** When evaluating new harness/use case: "does this work in bounded episodes?" If yes, kit applies. Abstract over gaps, not episode types.
