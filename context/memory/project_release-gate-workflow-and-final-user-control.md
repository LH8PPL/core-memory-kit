- **Staging steps** (assistant-driven):
  - Commit and push all fixes to release branch (e.g., PR #184).
  - Run full CI suite: Sonar gate, test suite, reference validation.
  - Once green, squash-merge release branch into `main`.
  - Verify `main` matches `origin/main` (working tree clean).
  - Finalize `package.json` version and CHANGELOG: bump version, finalize release section, reset [Unreleased] below it.
- **Outward gate** (user-controlled):
  - User executes: `git tag v0.3.1 && git push origin v0.3.1`.
  - This triggers `publish.yml`: test suite, npm publish with provenance, GitHub Release creation.

**Why:** Ensures all checks pass before any publishable artifact is created. User retains final control per D-126 (no auto-tagging from CI).

**How to apply:** Follow this workflow for each release. Staging is shared; tagging is user-only. The user's final tag + push command is the publication trigger.
