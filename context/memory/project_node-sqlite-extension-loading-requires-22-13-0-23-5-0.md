Node-sqlite's extension loading (binary swap in v13) landed in **22.13.0 / 23.5.0**, not 22.5. The floor for the module *appears* at 22.5 but the feature needed for this PR's test requires the later minor.

**Why:** Core-memory-kit's doc-walk and validator had the version wrong in three locations; incorrect floor blocks correct binary checks

**How to apply:** When setting Node floors for any dependency that uses native extensions, verify against Node release notes — "module appears" vs "feature stable" can differ
