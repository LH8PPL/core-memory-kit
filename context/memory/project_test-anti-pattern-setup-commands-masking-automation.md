Tests that run a manual setup command (e.g., cmk digest, cmk reindex) before asserting a behavior can hide the absence of an automatic hook.
  
  The test passes (because the manual command ran), but real users encounter the missing automation (because no hook runs it automatically).

**Why:** D-169: DECISIONS.md auto-population was fully tested but every test started with manual `cmk digest`. The feature worked in tests, failed in real use.

**How to apply:** When a test setup runs a manual command, ask: "Is this supposed to be automatic? Where's the hook that will actually trigger it?"
