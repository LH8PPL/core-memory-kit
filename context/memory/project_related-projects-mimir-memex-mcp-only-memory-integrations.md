**Mimir** (MakerViking/mimir): MCP-only; adds decision ↔ code-symbol linking and reinforcement learning (usage-based memory pruning). Overlaps with Task 176/190 learn-loop lanes.

**Memex** (STiFLeR7/memex): MCP-only; exhibits judgment-call failure (agent must decide to invoke tools).

**Key difference from our approach:** Both require agent to choose to call memory tools. Lifecycle-hooks approach is deterministic (fires at session boundaries, no choice).

**Why:** Comparative reference. Mimir's linking and reinforcement patterns relevant to project's learn-loop work. Neither was in prior research base (Task 50). Illuminates what "MCP-only" costs.

**How to apply:** Mimir worth reviewing for learn-loop design patterns (Task 176/190). Both illustrate the judgment-call failure that deterministic lifecycle hooks avoid.
