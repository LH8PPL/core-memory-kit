Field-wide pattern (15 projects studied): prefer per-agent CLI when installed (e.g., Kiro, Cursor), fall back to cloud-API-key direct call (e.g., Gemini free-tier, OpenRouter) when CLI absent. claude-mem is the load-bearing precedent: `CLAUDE_MEM_PROVIDER` switch (default "claude" → installed `claude` CLI, else "gemini"/"openrouter" → direct cloud-API calls). **No project in the field reverse-engineers a headless mode for a third-party agent.**

**Why:** Validates kit's two-tier architecture decision; confirms this is the canonical pattern others follow, not an edge case

**How to apply:** Implement cloud-API-key backend as explicit tier-2 fallback (when no agent CLI detected); document as "use this only when no agent is installed", not as primary path
