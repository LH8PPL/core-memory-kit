- v1 used brittle phrase-matching; v2 shifts to semantic intent matching (grounded in research: Anthropic's skill-creator + 9 cloned memory repos)
- v2 skill description: leads with general principle ("Fire whenever the answer might be something the project already established, however the question is phrased") + oblique example + hint-reference
- Key pattern from memsearch: skill description should explicitly reference the `[claude-memory-kit] Memory available` hint that appears per-turn; this link was missing in v1
- Deployed in cut-gate11 branch

**Why:** Phrase-matching fails for esoteric/roundabout questions; semantic intent + hint-reference generalizes across varied phrasings.

**How to apply:** Validate with deliberately oblique questions (e.g., "Why is everything so spread out?", "How come the route files barely have anything in them?"). Track whether memory-search fires for non-precise questions. Test in cut-gate11 after restarting Claude Code.
