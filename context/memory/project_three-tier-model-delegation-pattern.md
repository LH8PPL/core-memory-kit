For this repo, adopting:
  - **Fable 5 (lead)**: plan, decompose, review verdicts, merges, trivial edits
  - **Opus (deep reasoning)**: implementation, tests, debugging, self-review
  - **Sonnet (mechanical)**: boilerplate, sweeps, doc formatting, fixtures
  
Tests go to Opus (not Sonnet) because test discipline here is deep-reasoning work. History shows shipped bugs hiding in test coverage (five exit doors, mutation guards, prompt assertions). Thus tests require skill-review: Opus writes + self-reviews, Fable arbitrates and holds merge. Subagent isolation keeps lead's context focused and optimizes per-model token cost.

**Why:** Prior shipped bugs hid in test discipline, justifying deep-reasoning (Opus) not mechanical (Sonnet) for tests. Matches model to task complexity. Reduces context bloat.

**How to apply:** Implement in `.claude/agents/` (three agent definitions). Trial on Task 233. Verify with adoption-verification template (quality parity + cost savings).
