The ordering that works in production:
1. Explicit config (env var or config file, if user has set one)
2. Detect Claude environment (CLAUDE_CODE_ENTRYPOINT or claude on PATH)
3. Detect other CLI (codex, kiro-cli, cursor-agent — in priority order)
4. API-key fallback (when no CLI is available)

**Why:** codemem uses this ordering to handle real-world edge cases (user may have multiple CLIs, auth-state issues, no CLI at all). Proven in the field; saves re-deriving the ordering.

**How to apply:** Implement this chain in makeBackend selector logic. Test each branch independently.
