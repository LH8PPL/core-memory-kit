Fable 5's security keyword filter is intentionally overly-broad and classifies defensive security coding (e.g., building secret guards, poison guards) the same way it classifies attacks. Task 216 (screening content for secrets before committed writes) is vocabulary-dense enough to trigger the filter constantly, causing automatic model swap to Opus 4.8.

**Why:** Predicting and handling model swaps in future security-heavy tasks. The swaps are not errors—they're intentional safeguards, but knowing the trigger helps avoid confusion.

**How to apply:** For security-heavy tasks, either preempt with `/model claude-opus-4-8` to avoid banners, or accept the auto-swaps as normal for this class of work. Nothing is broken; Opus 4.8 handles the work fine.
