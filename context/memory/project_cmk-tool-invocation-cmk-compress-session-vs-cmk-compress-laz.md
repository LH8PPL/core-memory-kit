- `cmk-compress-session`: Meant to be invoked BY Claude Code at session-end. Running manually in terminal causes hangs (stdin/TTY or model spawn issues).
- `cmk-compress-lazy`: Standalone-friendly equivalent; safe for manual testing.
- Correct test paths: use `cmk-compress-lazy` for manual verification, or trigger via Claude Code session close (DJ6-live).

**Why:** Manual testing of cmk-compress-session led to confusion and hung processes; understanding the tool's intended context prevents wasted debugging.

**How to apply:** When testing compression/journal features, use cmk-compress-lazy or trigger via Claude Code session close, not cmk-compress-session from terminal.
