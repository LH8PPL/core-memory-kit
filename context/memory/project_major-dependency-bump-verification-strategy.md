- Full test suite: all passing (3341/3341 on v13)
- A/B acceptance: run prior published version vs. new build in clean sandbox; compare for unexpected regressions (e.g., deprecation warnings)
- Smoke tests: verify key features using the bumped dep (e.g., FTS5 search, sqlite-vec KNN loading, extension init)
- Regression verification: confirm unrelated features untouched (e.g., D-162's node:sqlite rejection)

**Why:** Major versions can break features silently or introduce tool noise. A/B acceptance catches tool-level changes unit tests miss.

**How to apply:** Use this checklist before merging any major dependency bump. Suite alone isn't enough.
