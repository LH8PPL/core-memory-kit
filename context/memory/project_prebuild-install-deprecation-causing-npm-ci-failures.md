npm ci fails due to deprecated `prebuild-install` native path. Task 141b covers migration off it. First symptom observed in v0.6.1 release; expect recurrence in future releases until migration is complete. Do not dismiss these as transient flakes.

**Why:** Known deprecation moving toward removal. Symptom will repeat predictably until the root cause (task 141b) is addressed.

**How to apply:** When you see prebuild-install-related CI failures, reference task 141b as the root cause, not a flaky test. Prioritize the migration in the next release cycle.
