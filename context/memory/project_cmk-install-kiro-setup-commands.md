Working bootstrap sequence for Kiro IDE gate testing:
  - `mkdir C:\Temp\kiro-ide-gate<N>`
  - `cd C:\Temp\kiro-ide-gate<N>`
  - `git init`
  - `cmk install --with-semantic --ide kiro`
  - `cmk doctor` (to verify hooks + backend)
  - **Restart Kiro** to load repacked hooks

After restart, the folder is ready for a live chat session.

**Why:** The user is iterating on a D-303 proof for auto-extract; clean, reproducible gate setup saves re-discovery.

**How to apply:** Use this sequence when setting up a new test environment. Gate10 is preferred over gate2 (which had pre-existing state).
