G4 gate now requires comprehensive verification across all three memory tiers (~/.claude-memory-kit, cut-gate14/context, cut-gate14/context.local). Marked as ★ cut-blocker — a failed G4 blocks release.

Checks: no username leak, no unrendered `{{TODAY}}`, examples marked `(example)`, frontmatter well-formed, no real paths in committed tier.

**Why:** Prevent accidentally committed secrets/paths in public release. The upgrade ensures this cannot be missed.

**How to apply:** When running cut-gate14, G4 will automatically sweep all three tiers. If G4 fails, audit those locations before retrying.
