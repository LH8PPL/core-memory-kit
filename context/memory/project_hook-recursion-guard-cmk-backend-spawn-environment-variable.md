When LLM backend is spawned from inside kit's own hooks (e.g., a hook calls `kiro-cli`):
  - Dispatcher entry checks for `CMK_BACKEND_SPAWN` env var
  - If set: inner hooks become no-op (skip their LLM spawning logic)
  - Env var propagates through spawned processes
  - Effect: prevents infinite recursion (reproduced live during Task 200 research)

**Why:** Backends need to be callable from within hook execution; without guard, infinite loop occurs

**How to apply:** Set `CMK_BACKEND_SPAWN` when spawning LLM backend; check it in dispatcher entry to conditionally disable hook setup for inner invocations
