nt (MIT, Go) auto-mirrors Claude Code's TodoWrite task-list into durable storage via a PostToolUse hook (idempotent, tagged `src:claude`).

This captures agent task state — a surface we don't currently extract: the agent's own live task list/progress, independent of conversation turns.

**Why:** Reveals an underexplored capture channel. Task state is metadata-rich and orthogonal to user messaging; complements conversation-turn extraction.

**How to apply:** Evaluate whether auto-capturing agent task lists (TodoWrite or equivalent) would improve memory fidelity when agents run between user interactions.
