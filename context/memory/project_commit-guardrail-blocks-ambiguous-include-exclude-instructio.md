The project has a safety guardrail that detects and blocks commits when the instruction is ambiguous about include/exclude intent. During this session, it flagged the typo "ocluding" (ambiguous for include vs exclude) in the user's commit instruction, blocked the command execution, and rolled back any partial work. The user clarified by explicitly stating "including," and the command succeeded on retry.

**Why:** Prevents silent commits with unclear intent, especially for large-scope operations like `git add -A`.

**How to apply:** Use explicit language in commit instructions (e.g., "commit and push including the memory" or "excluding the memory"). If a command is blocked, clarify your intent using unambiguous include/exclude directives.
