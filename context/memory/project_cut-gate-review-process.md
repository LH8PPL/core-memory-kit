Before release/merge, unverified items go to a formal "cut-gate" review session (e.g., DJ4 labels unverified decision-journal items). The gate allows manual verification or deliberate acceptance of known gaps before merge.

**Why:** The project distinguishes live-tested (real data) from synthetic-tested (fixtures) from untested (behavioral). Unverified items are explicitly flagged rather than claimed complete.

**How to apply:** When a feature can't be fully live-tested, flag it; the cut-gate session decides whether to manually verify or accept the gap before release.
