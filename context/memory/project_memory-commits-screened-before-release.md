- Dogfood memory changes (context/ directory) must be screened before commit
- Screening checks: name-validator compliance + gitignore violation detection
- Memory commit is part of pre-release checklist, before tagging and pushing
- This ensures documentation/memory is in sync with the release version

**Why:** Prevents orphaned uncommitted changes after release; keeps memory system trustworthy and auditable

**How to apply:** Include memory screening and commit as a required pre-release verification step; apply rules per ADR-0018
