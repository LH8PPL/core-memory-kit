Fix lint/style warnings encountered in touched files even when pre-existing (not from my edit) — never dismiss them as 'pre-existing, not mine'.

**Why:** The user's 2026-07-18 directive: 'always fix stuff like list-indent style warning even if it isnt from your edit' — repeated dismissals of markdownlint warnings (MD007/MD022/MD060) prompted it

**How to apply:** When an IDE diagnostic or linter warning surfaces on a file being worked on, fix it in the same batch (or a dedicated style commit if the diff is large); leave touched files cleaner than found
