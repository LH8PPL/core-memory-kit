The decision to use global agent config for kiro-cli was previously undocumented and appeared to be a potential bug. Investigation (prompted by user's "did you check the docs?" challenge) confirmed the behavior was correct; merged decision record + primary-source comment to main.

**Why:** Undocumented architectural constraints can be misread as bugs and trigger unnecessary code changes. Documenting the rationale prevents future re-opening.

**How to apply:** Reference D-283 if the global config is questioned. The constraint is permanent.
