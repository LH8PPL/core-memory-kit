When advancing a task from one decision/lane to another, preserve the old lane/state in the record rather than overwriting it. Cite the decision-trail rule.

**Why:** Maintains full traceability of how decisions and tasks evolved; supports root-cause analysis and pattern spotting in future refactors.

**How to apply:** When closing, advancing, or re-diagnosing a task/decision: note the old lane/state in the record (e.g., "Old lane preserved per the decision-trail rule"), don't overwrite it.
