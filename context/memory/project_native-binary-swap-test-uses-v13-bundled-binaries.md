The cross-OS native-binary swap test (CI's load-bearing check) installs the kit with v13's bundled binaries and runs `doctor` clean on each OS: windows-2022, macos-14, ubuntu-22.04.

**Why:** Validates that bundled binaries work correctly across all target platforms before shipping a native-binary version change.

**How to apply:** When reviewing native-binary PRs or examining CI results, this cross-OS test using v13 binaries is the definitive check for native-binary compatibility.
