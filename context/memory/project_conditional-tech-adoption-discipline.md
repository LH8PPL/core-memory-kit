Before committing to a new library/approach (backend, embedder, etc.), run a measurement gate that proves it doesn't degrade the user-facing metric that matters most. Examples: D-109 (embedder quality via R@5), D-147 (storage perf vs better-sqlite3).

**Why:** Prevents trading UX/performance for technical elegance or convenience on faith. Forces explicit data-driven decisions.

**How to apply:** When evaluating a new tech, propose a bake-off (what to measure, what's the bar) before implementation. Document the gate in DECISION-LOG + tasks.md. Don't ship without data.
