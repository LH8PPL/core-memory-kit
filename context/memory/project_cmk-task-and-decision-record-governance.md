- Tasks assigned sequential IDs (142, 143, etc.) with optional letter suffixes (141a for subtasks)
- Decision Records (prefixed D-) document rationale for non-adopted proposals; enables future context
- Work organized by release lanes (v0.3.x currently active); tasks within each lane prioritized by value
- Dangling references are caught and backfilled during scheduling

**Why:** Codifies cmk's project management model — how work, decisions, and priorities are tracked

**How to apply:** Use sequential task IDs; create D-records for considered-but-rejected features; rank within lanes by impact/leverage
