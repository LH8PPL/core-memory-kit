- **Stage 0**: Minimal FastAPI + WebSocket + `index.html` in `app.py`
- **Stage 1**: Refactor to layered `app/{api,services,repositories,schemas,core}/` → state rule: "FastAPI is delivery not brain"
- **Stage 2**: Swap to Claude Agent SDK → state rule: Type-hints + TDD (test-first)
- **Stage 3**: Stream output + async support → state rule: async-first + cross-project rule (uv/ruff)

Each stage includes "Say the rule out loud" to trigger IDE capture.

**Why:** Session 1 workflow; captures reasoning in hooks for future sessions' context.

**How to apply:** Follow stages 0→3 in order, stating each rule out loud after implementation. IDE capture will record in `context\sessions\{date}.md`.
