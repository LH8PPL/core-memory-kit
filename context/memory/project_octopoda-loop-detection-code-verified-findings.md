**Engine:** 10 deterministic classifiers (not 5 as README claimed); pure functions, stdlib-only (`difflib`), explicit thresholds, zero unit tests. Precision/recall figures unmeasured (all `None`). **Actionable:** `reflection.py` suppresses benign patterns (rolling summaries, heartbeats, recovery markers, goal re-plans) — direct precedent for Task 250's noise-threshold amendment. Pure classifier shape runs on event logs; kit's audit.log/extract.log/DECISIONS.md feed directly. Would have caught D-298 cron-starvation class. SDK-side recall injection validates Task 233's SessionStart bet. **Gap:** Retry/nondeterminism detectors require tool-call log (kit doesn't write). Server runtime (Postgres, pgvector, dashboard) out of scope.

**Why:** Closes half the corpus gap (detection algorithms). Directly feeds Task 250 (loop-detection prior art), Task 212 (process-health metrics architecture), Task 233 (recall-nudging validation). Unvalidated quality informs risk assessment.

**How to apply:** Reference findings when implementing Task 212's classifier shape and Task 250's benign-pattern suppressor. Track missing tool-call-log as prerequisite gap for full coverage.
