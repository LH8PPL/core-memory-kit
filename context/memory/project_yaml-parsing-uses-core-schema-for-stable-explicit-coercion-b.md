- **Tool**: js-yaml 4.3.0 (minor upgrade from 4.2.0)
- **API**: `yaml.load` / `yaml.dump` with `CORE_SCHEMA` (js-yaml's most conservative schema)
- **Behavior**: avoids implicit Date/timestamp coercion; ensures explicit, predictable round-trip behavior
- **Stability**: CORE_SCHEMA semantics stable across the 4.x line
- **Test coverage**: frontmatter round-trip verified in cli-write-fact, cli-frontmatter suites (all passing)

**Why:** Explicit, non-coercive yaml parsing prevents surprising type conversions that could break frontmatter handling or downstream logic. Conservative schema choice + comprehensive test coverage minimizes risk when updating js-yaml.

**How to apply:** When modifying yaml parsing or upgrading js-yaml, maintain CORE_SCHEMA. Ensure frontmatter round-trip tests remain green. Treat CORE_SCHEMA and the explicit load/dump API as the stable boundary.
