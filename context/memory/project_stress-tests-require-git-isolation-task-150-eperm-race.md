Running `git` commands while stress tests are in flight causes an EPERM race condition (Task-150). Workaround: stay off git until stress test suite completes.

**Why:** Prior incident: parallel git + stress caused file lock races, breaking reproducibility.

**How to apply:** When running stress tests, avoid all git operations in parallel. Wait for stress to complete and report before committing or other git actions.
