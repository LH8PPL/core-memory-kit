- **Issue:** Kiro bug #5873 prevents the `mk_remember` tool from routing to custom assistants like claude-memory-kit's Kiro CLI integration.
- **Symptom:** Manual save commands appear to succeed in chat but don't actually persist memory.
- **Status:** Known Kiro issue (public GitHub issue); waiting on Kiro team to fix their tool-routing logic. Claude-memory-kit code is correct and will work once Kiro fixes their end.
- **Workaround:** Rely on automatic end-of-turn memory extraction (the primary feature), which works reliably.
- **Decision:** Merge the fixes with documentation of this limitation; advise users to depend on automatic capture.

**Why:** Future sessions need to know kiro-cli's primary working feature (automatic capture) and why manual saves are unavailable, so docs reflect reality and users have clear guidance.

**How to apply:** Document this limitation in kiro-cli support/release notes; emphasize automatic extraction as the stable, recommended mechanism; guide users to rely on end-of-turn memory capture rather than manual saves.
