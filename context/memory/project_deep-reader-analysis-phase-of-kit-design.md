Three deep-reader instances (all Sonnet) are actively analyzing prior art systems to inform the final design proposal:
- **memclaw** — PII-quarantine approach (noted as closest prior art)
- **hermes** — Two-boundary write+inject screen architecture
- **Memoria/Honcho/gitleaks/A-MemGuard bundle** — Related memory/detection systems

Findings will be synthesized into the final design proposal.

**Why:** These are primary reference implementations; their design choices will shape the kit's architecture

**How to apply:** Refer to deep-reader findings when finalizing design decisions; treat these systems as evidence for architectural choices
