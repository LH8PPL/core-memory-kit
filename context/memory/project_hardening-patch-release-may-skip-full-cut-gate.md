For a patch release with no new differentiators, full test suite + stress test passing, and two-pass review, running the cut-gate is optional. The gate's primary value is catching "unit-green, real-input-broken" (D-84 class) bugs—lower priority for hardening patches with minimal new code.

**Why:** Streamlines release process for low-risk patches while retaining the option to run gates for higher-risk releases.

**How to apply:** Assess each patch release: new differentiators? full test coverage? two-pass reviewed? If all yes and code is primarily bug-fixes, cut directly is defensible; otherwise run full gate.
