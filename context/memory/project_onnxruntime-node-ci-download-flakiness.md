- The project includes `onnxruntime-node` as an optional semantic embedder dependency
- During `npm ci`, it downloads a large binary that causes timeouts on shared CI runners
- Failure mode: `ETIMEDOUT` when downloading the binary during npm install
- Known workaround: Re-run the job — almost always succeeds on retry
- Persistent failures should trigger workflow tweaks (retry logic, caching)

**Why:** Distinguishes transient network flakes from real code/release problems; prevents false alarm investigation

**How to apply:** When CI publish fails with ETIMEDOUT on onnxruntime-node, retry the job first. Only investigate deeper if retries consistently fail. If it becomes a pattern, add retry/caching to publish.yml.
