kiro-cli reads MCP `allowedTools` from the **active agent's config**, not the project globally. Approval prompts surface when the active agent hasn't granted permission. Prior auto-approval work targets a specific agent, not the project as a whole.

**Why:** User tested and found approval prompt despite prior auto-approval setup; analysis revealed MCP trust is read per-agent config, not globally. Prompt appeared because kiro_default (the active agent at test time) didn't have `allowedTools` configured.

**How to apply:** To ensure prompt-free MCP: either (1) set the auto-approved agent as `chat.defaultAgent` global, or (2) add `allowedTools` to every agent config that will invoke MCP tools. Project-wide approval is not possible; approval is fundamentally per-agent.
