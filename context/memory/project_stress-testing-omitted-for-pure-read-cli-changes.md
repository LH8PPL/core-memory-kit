For code changes that consist of pure-read analysis + CLI print output with no spawn/hook/concurrency surface, stress testing is consciously omitted. This decision is documented per the D-120 precedent.

**Why:** Pure-read analysis and CLI printing introduce no concurrency or spawning risks, making stress tests unnecessary and allowing them to be skipped to save CI time.

**How to apply:** When evaluating whether to run stress tests on a PR, check if the change is pure-read analysis + CLI print only. If so, stress testing may be omitted per the D-120 precedent.
