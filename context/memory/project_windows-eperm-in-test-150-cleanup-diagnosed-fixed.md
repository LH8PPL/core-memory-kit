**Root cause of stress test flake (2/10 failure rate):** Task-150 cleanup uses bare `rmSync` while a spawned git child process still holds the tempdir file handle, causing Windows EPERM errors.

**Applied fix:** Drain guard pattern (established in sibling test suites) to allow spawned processes to release file handles before cleanup proceeds. Cleanup-only change; assertions unchanged.

**Status:** Fix deployed; stress suite re-running for verification (5 passes required before commit/PR).

**Why:** Reproducible flaky failure with clear root cause; drain guard is an established codebase pattern for this exact scenario

**How to apply:** Reference this incident when similar Windows file handle issues appear in test cleanup; apply drain guard pattern from sibling suites as the standard remedy
