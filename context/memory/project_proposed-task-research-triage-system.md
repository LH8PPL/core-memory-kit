When deciding if a task needs external research:
1. Check D-374 sweep for prior-art annotations already on the task entry
2. If notes are older than ~60 days AND task is about a live/copyable project → re-verify against current repo or web search
3. If task is in one of three corpus-gap areas → research is required:
   - Self-healing CLI repair UX
   - Command-obfuscation detection  
   - npm native-dep migration

Unconditional rule: Any task involving copying implementation details from another project always gets a fresh look at that project, regardless of note age.

For all other tasks (internal hygiene, no external copying), skip external research and note so explicitly.

**Why:** Notes decay rapidly on live projects—a May note is now ~2 months stale, making it a lead rather than ground truth. Uniform re-research on all tasks is wasteful (8 tasks have no external corpus to verify against). Targeted re-verification of copying-focused tasks catches real risks with minimal overhead.

**How to apply:** Run the three-question triage at task start. This approach is pending post-compact codification in CLAUDE.md as part of refined task research discipline.
