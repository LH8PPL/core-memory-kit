OpenWolf is the only peer sharing the kit's architecture (scheduled job + liveness check) and independently implemented the exact heartbeat fix (last_heartbeat via statSync().mtimeMs). Also has file-index and token-ledger patterns worth deeper exploration later.

**Why:** Real-world validation that heartbeat approach works at scale; confirms both architecture fit and derive-from-artifact strategy.

**How to apply:** Reference OpenWolf when grounding cron-liveness decisions. Flag for deeper dive into file-index and token-ledger patterns for future optimization.
