SonarCloud's hotspot review interface does not offer "Acknowledged" status. For assessed risks (especially negligible exposure in bounded contexts), record the review by marking as **Safe** and commenting with:
- Risk analysis and why it is negligible
- Input/exposure constraints
- Fix timeline (e.g., queued for v0.3.x)

This preserves assessment rationale for future reference and avoids false-positive hotspot debt.

**Why:** Tool limitation requires documented workaround; risk assessment and rationale must be visible to team and future sessions

**How to apply:** When closing hotspots after risk analysis, use Safe + comment pattern instead of searching for Acknowledged status
