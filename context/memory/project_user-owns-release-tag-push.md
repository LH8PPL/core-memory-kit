User is the authority for pushing release tags to origin. This is the final, outward-facing step of releases and remains the user's responsibility, never assistant's. It's a standing rule that separates internal work from external visibility.

**Why:** Clear boundary between development decisions (assistant) and public commitments (user). Prevents unintended early releases.

**How to apply:** On every release cycle, remind user that tag push is their step. Provide the command; never execute it yourself.
