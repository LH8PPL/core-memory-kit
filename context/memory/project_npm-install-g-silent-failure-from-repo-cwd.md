Running `npm install -g core-memory-kit@latest` from inside the project root exits 0 but silently leaves the old version installed. Only works from a neutral cwd. Discovered by post-execution verification (`cmk version`), not by exit code.

**Why:** Users following install docs from their project root will silently get stale versions. This needs to be fixed before v0.6.2 release.

**How to apply:** Before v0.6.2 ships, investigate root cause (npm quirk vs. project setup issue) and audit/update install instructions if needed.
