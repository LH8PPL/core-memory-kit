During npm install on Windows, a file-lock error (`EPERM`) may appear for `better_sqlite3.node` during cleanup. This is not a failure — the install completes successfully (logs "added X packages, changed Y"), and `cmk --version` confirms the installed version. It is Windows-npm cleanup noise, not a blocking error.

**Why:** Prevents user panic or false failure detection in future test runs; the warning can be safely ignored.

**How to apply:** If you see this warning during npm install, verify the success message and run `cmk --version` to confirm the correct version installed — do not treat it as a failure.
