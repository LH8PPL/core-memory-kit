Sort ordering in the map module must be explicit and deterministic across all machines:
- `localeCompare()` is explicitly banned because it breaks byte-stability across different locales and machines
- All sorts must use byte-stable comparisons (e.g., default string comparison) instead of locale-aware or implicit ordering
- Output is verified with real-corpus before/after diffs to ensure byte-identical results across development environments

**Why:** The map module generates committed artifacts (`MAP.md`) that are included in version control and must be reproducible across all machines. Locale-dependent or implicit sorting causes non-deterministic output, breaking the determinism guarantee that the map depends on.

**How to apply:** When implementing sorts in map-module code, make all comparisons explicit and byte-stable. Validate with real-corpus diffs before committing to confirm byte-identical output. Never use `localeCompare()` for map-module comparisons. The Sonar gate will catch violations of this rule.
