Cursor agent feasibility assessment:
  - `cursor-agent -p --output-format json` documented to exist
  - Auth: via `CURSOR_API_KEY` environment variable
  - Status: feasible per docs, but `cursor-agent` not installed on this machine
  - Blocker: exact `--model` and `--no-tools` flags need live probe of `cursor-agent --help` during build phase

**Why:** Task 200 assessment of both Kiro and Cursor as backend options; can't confirm flag behavior from docs alone

**How to apply:** Schedule live-probe of `cursor-agent --help` during Task 200 build phase (before full implementation); confirm --model flags and tool-disabling mechanism work as expected
