- Decision date: June 2026 (documented in D-162)
- Reason for rejection: Comprehensive testing showed performance regression — FTS5 keyword search ~10% slower; incremental reindex ~32% slower vs. current better-sqlite3 approach
- Status: Closed; not a candidate for reconsideration on performance grounds alone

**Why:** This decision was based on measured performance data and represents a deliberate choice to maintain SQLite with better-sqlite3 for FTS search performance

**How to apply:** If future architecture discussions touch on alternative SQLite drivers or node:sqlite, reference D-162 and the performance tradeoffs documented there
