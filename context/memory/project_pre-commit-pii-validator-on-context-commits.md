A pre-commit hook validates `context/` commits using a "name-confinement validator" that detects and rejects PII/secrets (emails, API keys, tokens, etc.). If PII is detected, the commit fails and must be cleaned before re-staging. This prevents accidental leaks of sensitive data to the public repository.

**Why:** The project repository is public. Accidental commits of personal/sensitive info are a real risk. The validator is the automated gate that stops these commits before they reach the repo. (Tested live this session: the validator caught an accidentally-written email and forced removal.)

**How to apply:** When committing changes to `context/`, the pre-commit screen runs automatically as a gate. If the name-confinement check fails, remove the flagged PII, re-stage, and run the screen again. Always allow the screen to run before pushing.
