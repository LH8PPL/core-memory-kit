- All gate sections pass; release verified and ready for publication
- Local main is behind upstream; must pull before tagging to capture all fixes
- Tagging sequence: `git checkout main` → `git pull` → `git tag v0.5.1` → `git push origin v0.5.1`
- Tag push triggers publish.yml (npm publish + GitHub Release automation)
- Fixes included: Task 222 (install silence), Task 223 (E2 label), CHANGELOG correction

**Why:** Pull synchronizes with upstream; omitting it would tag a stale commit missing Task 222 and CHANGELOG fixes

**How to apply:** Follow sequence exactly. Confirm local main is synced before tagging; automation handles npm and GitHub Release on push.
