Two options: (a) secondary scheduled run at a different time to reduce chance both cron cycles miss, or (b) accept manual dispatch as the primary backstop and own the schedule. Prefer a decision recorded in the watch workflow config.

**Why:** GitHub's cron unreliability exposed in this cycle; Task 237's delivery depends on the watch running reliably.

**How to apply:** Document the chosen strategy in the watch workflow and release checklist before cutting v0.6.2.
