The claude-memory-kit installation includes a Windows scheduled task `cmk-daily-distill` that:
- Runs daily at 23:00 (11 PM) Windows time
- Launches node.exe as a console application (visible black window for 1-2 minutes)
- Completes successfully with no errors
- Harmless but a UX wart when it pops during evening use

Fix is known: register task to run hidden (session-0) or use a windowless launcher; tracked as Task 215.

**Why:** Next session will need to recognize this 23:00 popup as expected behavior, not a bug

**How to apply:** If black console window appears at 23:00, it's cmk-daily-distill (harmless); to eliminate, implement Task 215 fix
