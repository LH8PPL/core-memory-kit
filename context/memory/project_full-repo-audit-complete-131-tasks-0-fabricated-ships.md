- All shipped tasks verified against live code; zero claimed-but-missing implementations
- 100% of open tasks now laned or have trigger condition
- Doc drift fixed: ARCHITECTURE, lifecycle-map, tasks.md stale header corrected
- 5 findings filed as tasks

**Why:** Confirms implementation fidelity and doc accuracy before major releases; surfaces process gaps and stale markers

**How to apply:** Archive shipped v0.1.0 body (~850 lines) into frozen file with links (optional, low-priority); reference audit approach for future verification sprints
