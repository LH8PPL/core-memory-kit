Three surfaces being gated against their respective probes:
- **kiro-cli (V3 2.9.0)**: full gate with KC1/KC2/KC3 + M-wedge + KG-observe + V3 guard-fallback; covers D-199/D-200 fixes — live/real work
- **Kiro IDE (0.x)**: legacy KH1/KH2 (capture+inject fire) re-confirm on rebuilt global
- **IDE v1 (KHv1-*)**: explicitly skipped (requires IDE 1.0; user on 0.x) — documented, not a blocker

The gate is mostly kiro-cli validation + IDE legacy re-confirm.

**Why:** User's installed versions determine which probes are active vs skipped. IDE v1 is not in scope yet but is explicitly documented as such.

**How to apply:** When running the gate, expect full coverage on kiro-cli, partial on IDE legacy (KH1/KH2), none on IDE v1. Use this table to avoid surprises.
