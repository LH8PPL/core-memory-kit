The temporal sweep (stale "current state" contradiction-catch) now runs at:
- SessionEnd hook
- SessionStart (lazy)
- Weekly backstop

Previously: weekly-only. This change lets a state change captured in one session self-correct by the next session boundary.

Zero cost on idle sessions when semantic detection is enabled (θ=0.80).

**Why:** Vercel→Hetzner state-change case showed weekly-only timing was too slow; session-boundary timing catches it within one cycle.

**How to apply:** All three hooks are in SessionEnd and SessionStart-lazy handlers; no config needed. Enable semantic detection if desired.
