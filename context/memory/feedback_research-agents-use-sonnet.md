Subagent/research fan-outs should run on SONNET, not the session's main model — the user's explicit call (2026-07-07): "if you are going to use agents for the research, use sonnet."

**Why:** Research/survey agent work (cloning repos, reading code, web surveys) doesn't need the top-tier model; the user wants the cheaper/faster tier for fan-out work.

**How to apply:** When spawning Agent-tool subagents for research, surveys, code-reading, or other fan-out tasks, pass model: 'sonnet' explicitly. Applies to Workflow agent() calls too (opts.model). The main conversation stays on the session model.
