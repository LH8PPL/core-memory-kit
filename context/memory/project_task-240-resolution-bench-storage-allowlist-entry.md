Bench-storage.yml divergence from .nvmrc Node pin was formalized into validator's LITERAL_ALLOWLIST. Early D-383 decision to move it onto .nvmrc would have crashed the workflow:
- `bench-storage.mjs:29` imports `node:sqlite` unconditionally at module scope
- `node:sqlite` module requires Node ≥22.5; does not exist in Node 20
- Every run fails on import, not a confound or measurement skew

**Resolution**: Bench-storage keeps Node 24 as explicit allowlist entry. Allowlist docstring updated (no longer empty). Entry includes comment citing ≥22.5 requirement.

**Why:** File's own header comment documented this floor but was not consulted during bulk pattern-matching sweep. D-384 lesson: bulk refactors require reading context.

**How to apply:** When adding to allowlist, read target file to understand why it needs a different Node version. Allowlist entry and its rationale must move together.
