Five live-tested probes verified in sandbox before v0.4.3 release:
- **PR1**: Rich fact re-statement bumps `recurrence_count` (1→2) + audit line. Quirk: requires rich flag, not bare `remember`.
- **PR2**: USER persona over cap condenses correctly, never strands to `fragments/`.
- **PR3**: `trust_score` column migration is non-destructive. (Score value only suite-covered; no direct readout.)
- **PR4**: No-`--to` flag promotes route to 3 files. Quirk: requires `init-user-tier` first.
- **PR5**: Zero-width Unicode in `cmk remember` exits with code 2, writes nothing. Quirk: bare form triggers exit 2.

Three layers flagged **MANUAL**: gate logic, spoken mention, MCP path (CLI cannot assert these).

**Why:** This is the baseline gate for v0.4.3; documents what was verified before release and establishes the pattern for future gate iterations.

**How to apply:** When designing v0.4.4 cut-gate, use PR1–PR5 as the minimum baseline and reference these quirks in new checks.
