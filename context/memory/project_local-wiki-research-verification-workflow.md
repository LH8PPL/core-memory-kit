User maintains a structured research pipeline:
- Source materials → `/raw/` directory
- Parallel background agents verify sources against 7-point checklists
- Verified notes written to `docs/research/`
- Full integration commit includes: INDEX registration, SOURCES rows, DECISION-LOG entries, task annotations

**Why:** Enables efficient batch verification and maintains audit trail for research credibility

**How to apply:** When processing new research batches, use parallel agents for verification before writing to `docs/research/` and committing integration metadata
