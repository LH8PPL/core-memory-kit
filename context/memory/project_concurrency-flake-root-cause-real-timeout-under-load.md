Under 5× suite concurrency, real `git status` calls exceeded the 400ms production leash, triggering the designed silent-degrade fallback. This is the correct production behavior. The test flake was timing-dependent: absence-asserting tests expected no timeout, but the timeout actually fired under realistic load.

**Why:** Helps distinguish production bugs from test brittleness. The fallback behavior is correct by design; tests need injection seams to assert it reliably across load conditions.

**How to apply:** When writing timeout-critical assertions, use injection seams to decouple test timeouts from production leashes. Verify fallback behavior is reached and handled correctly under the intended load.
