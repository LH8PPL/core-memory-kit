The claude-memory-kit's MCP server (`cmk mcp serve`) locks SQLite DLLs on Windows, breaking reinstalls if the server is running. Current workaround: kill the server procs before reinstalling. Details: Task 205 / Decision D-302 (memory P-aLLW62HD). Priority: v0.5.1, not v0.5.0 blocker. Fix approach: detect/stop own server, retry-on-EBUSY, or preserve old global + recovery guidance.

**Why:** Known bug affecting Windows workflow. Not a tag blocker but needs proper fix in v0.5.1. Future sessions need the workaround, tracking info, and awareness that this is a temporary patch, not normal procedure.

**How to apply:** Before Windows reinstalls, kill any running `cmk mcp serve` procs. Check Task 205/D-302 when v0.5.1 work starts. Remember this is a workaround, not the real fix.
