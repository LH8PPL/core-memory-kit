The hook subprocess is instantiated on each turn and does not persist across turns. Fixes to hook code become active immediately without requiring session restart.

**Why:** Enables rapid iteration on hook fixes; fixes are live in the same session window

**How to apply:** Test hook bug fixes inline without restarting; fixes become active on the next turn
