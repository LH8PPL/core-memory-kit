After each version ships, update `recent.md` with an authoritative block stating which version shipped and which is next (e.g., "v0.3.2 SHIPPED, v0.3.3 NEXT"). This prevents stale snapshots from confusing new sessions about the current version state.

**Why:** New sessions load memory to understand project state. A stale version snapshot would make them think an older version is current (e.g., v0.3.1 when v0.3.2 shipped). The snapshot is a guard rail for session continuity.

**How to apply:** After each version ship, add/update the version block in `recent.md`, commit + push it so new sessions read the correct state on first load.
