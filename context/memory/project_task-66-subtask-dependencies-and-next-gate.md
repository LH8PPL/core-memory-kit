Task 66 has four subtasks with out-of-sequence delivery. 66.1 (shape classification) and 66.3 (expires_at enforcement) are complete. 66.2 and 66.4 (validity windows + contradiction-catch demo) are gated on design-grilling to resolve:
- `state_key` heuristic vs. LLM detection pass for contradiction detection
- captain-claw's "hold the tension" idea (D-221) vs. latest-wins rule

**Why:** Task 66.2/66.4 cannot proceed until these design forks are resolved; contradiction-DETECTION strategy is the critical path blocker.

**How to apply:** Next session: run design grill interview before 66.2/66.4 implementation. Outcome determines contradiction-catch demo surface architecture.
