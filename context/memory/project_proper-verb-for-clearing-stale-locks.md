Use `cmk repair --locks` to clear stale locks. The kit enforces a delete-guardrail that blocks raw `Remove-Item` attempts, making the repair verb the only safe path.

**Why:** The guardrail prevents accidental data loss and ensures consistency with kit-provided tooling.

**How to apply:** Always use `cmk repair --locks` in future sessions; never resort to raw filesystem deletions for lock cleanup.
