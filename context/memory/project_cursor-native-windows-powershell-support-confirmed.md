Cursor ships native Windows PowerShell installer (`irm 'https://cursor.com/install?win32=true' | iex`) as of late-Jan 2026. Prior Git-Bash "ports" cited in earlier research were historical artifacts predating this native support. **Critical validation caveat:** IDE had an installer bug through May 2026 that could run the Unix installer under Git Bash; PATH presence alone is insufficient — must probe `cursor-agent --version` exit code to confirm valid installation.

**Why:** Resolves Windows-platform blocker for agent support; confirms native Windows CLI path exists and is canonical

**How to apply:** Kit's Cursor backend should check `cursor-agent --version` exit code, not just check PATH presence; treat valid exit code as confirmation of headless capability
