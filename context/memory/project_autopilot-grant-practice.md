Autopilot merging is not enabled by default. It requires explicit user authorization:
- Per-PR: user says "automerge" when the PR is ready
- Per-batch: user grants autopilot for an entire task batch (e.g., "grant autopilot for v0.5.5: 230 → 96 → 210")

The assistant should not assume grants carry over between sessions or batches.

**Why:** Merging code is a high-blast-radius decision that requires explicit user authorization. Prevents accidental deployments.

**How to apply:** Before opening a PR, ask the user for authorization. Note: no standing autopilot grant exists for this session; request user decision before proceeding.
