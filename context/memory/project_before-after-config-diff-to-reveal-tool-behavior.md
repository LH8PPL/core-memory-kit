Before a user-facing action (e.g., clicking "allow"), snapshot key config files (settings.json, settings.local.json). After the action, diff to see exactly what the tool wrote — which file changed, which form/format used, which values added. This is un-fakeable ground truth.

**Why:** Tool docs are often ambiguous or outdated; the tool's actual output is authoritative.

**How to apply:** Use when tool behavior is unclear or docs conflict with observation. Snapshots capture before-state; diffs reveal exact changes.
