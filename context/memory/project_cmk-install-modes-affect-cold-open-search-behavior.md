`cmk install` with `--with-semantic` vs keyword-only have distinct effects on test reproducibility:
- **Persona injection (wedge)**: independent of mode
- **Memory-search recall** (used during cold-opens): affected by mode
- Keyword-only can cause paraphrased searches to miss facts that semantic mode finds

**Why:** Testing fixes under different configurations than the original bug report creates false-negative risk (test appears to fail when fix is actually working)

**How to apply:** When re-running cold-opens to validate fixes, use the same `cmk install` mode as the original runs that surfaced the issue
