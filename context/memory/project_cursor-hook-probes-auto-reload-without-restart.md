Cursor invokes the probe script fresh each turn via `cmd.exe /c node ...probe.mjs`, so edits to the probe file take effect immediately without restarting Cursor.

**Why:** Enables rapid iteration when debugging hook probes — no need to close/reopen the editor between test turns.

**How to apply:** When modifying probe scripts for debugging, send another turn in Cursor to see the updated output; do not restart.
