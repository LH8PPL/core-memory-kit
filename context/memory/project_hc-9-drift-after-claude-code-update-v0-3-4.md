After updating Claude Code, `cmk doctor` may report HC-9 (health check) drift from expected state. This is expected behavior in v0.3.4 — Claude Code updates invalidate cached state that `cmk` maintains. Fix: run `cmk install` to restore alignment. This is a feature, not a bug.

**Why:** v0.3.4 detects when tool updates diverge the cached state and provides a simple recovery path. A future session encountering this drift needs to know it's not indicative of a real problem.

**How to apply:** After updating Claude Code, if `cmk doctor` reports HC-9 drift, just run `cmk install` — no further investigation needed.
