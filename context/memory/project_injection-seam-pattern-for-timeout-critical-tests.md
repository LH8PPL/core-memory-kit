When testing behavior under a production timeout leash (e.g., 400ms git status limit), use an injectable timeout parameter to allow tests to run with a generous timeout while production retains the reviewed leash. Applied here via `testGitTimeoutMs`, mirroring the existing `testSpawnLazy` injection pattern.

**Why:** Under concurrent load (5× suite), production timeouts can actually fire, causing tests that assume quick completion to fail. Decouples test execution speed from production timeout behavior.

**How to apply:** Create an injectable parameter for each timeout-sensitive subsystem. Positive tests inject a high timeout; production code wires the reviewed leash. Follow existing injection idioms in the codebase when adding new ones.
