Claude Code 2.1.191 (and later) now requires BOTH `Skill(memory-write)` (bare form) AND `Skill(memory-write:*)` (wildcard form) in the allow-list to suppress permission prompts. Prior versions accepted the bare form alone. Without the wildcard form, prompts re-appear on the next tool call.

**Why:** The kit has used only the bare form since Task 90 (byte-unchanged). Claude Code 2.1.x changed its Skill() permission matching logic, requiring the kit to track this upstream change (as it does for Kiro hook-format updates). This is a real breaking change for end-users.

**How to apply:** When emitting allow-list entries for skill-based tools, always emit both forms. The fix is in `settings-hooks.mjs` KIT_ALLOW (the sole write-site for allow-list — both npm and plugin distributions funnel through it). Verify with install-hooks tests (27 tests) and install tests (32 tests).
