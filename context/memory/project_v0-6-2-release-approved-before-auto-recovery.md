User approved immediate release of v0.6.2 (breaking Node-20 drop), deferring orphaned-tier auto-recovery to v0.6.3. Rationale: install-path code written late in high-error session poses risk; ship the safe bleeding-stopper fix now, build recovery fresh for v0.6.3.

**Why:** v0.6.2 stops new stray tier creation; recovery can wait. Deferring to v0.6.3 keeps cmk install clean and avoids rushing code late in a long, error-prone session.

**How to apply:** Next session: v0.6.2 has been released to npm. Proceed with v0.6.3 focused on install-path auto-recovery (Task 248 reframed; Tasks 247/249 hygiene batch). Design at P-3PWCGWZH.
