kiro-cli agents cannot execute tool calls during chat without an explicit `tools: ['*']` field in their configuration. Without this field, tool calls are generated but silently fail to execute. The fix was a one-line config addition to grant the agent shell/system access.

**Why:** Tool execution was mysteriously failing (no error, just inert calls) because the permission gate was missing entirely — invisible until explicitly diagnosed

**How to apply:** When setting up or debugging kiro-cli projects with agent tool execution, verify the config includes `tools: ['*']` to enable inline command execution
