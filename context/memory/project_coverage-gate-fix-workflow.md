Approach taken to resolve SonarCloud coverage failure:
1. Identified root cause: coverage gap in runUninstall branches (73.9% < 80%)
2. Added test coverage for all four branches (default-claude, unknown-ide, kiro, nothing-to-remove)
3. Applied pattern consistency: made runUninstall honor injected log sinks to match runInstall
4. Verified full suite pass and 100% lines coverage for affected file (install-kiro.mjs: 2162/0)

**Why:** Systematic approach that addresses missing tests rather than superficial fixes; yields complete coverage.

**How to apply:** Apply this workflow when future coverage gates fail—identify missing branches, add tests, verify consistency with related code, re-run gate.
