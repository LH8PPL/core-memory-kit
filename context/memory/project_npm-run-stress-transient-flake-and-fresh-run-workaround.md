**Issue**: Load flake causes mid-run kills (e.g., killed during run-3, run-2 inconclusive). Not a real suite failure.
**Workaround**: Fresh run clears it. No fixed timeout (earlier run had timeout kill). Running 5/5 fresh pass authoritative before merge.

**Why:** Tool quirk affecting pre-merge gate reliability; must rule out false negatives

**How to apply:** If future stress fails mid-run, do not assume real failure—restart with fresh run
