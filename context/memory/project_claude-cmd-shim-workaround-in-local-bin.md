A `claude.cmd` shim was created in `.local/bin` that forwards to the working Claude Code native binary. Purpose: tests and scripts calling `claude.cmd` will resolve to the working install even after the broken npm-global copy is uninstalled.
- Shim: 2-line forwarder script
- Location: `.local/bin` (first on PATH, so it takes precedence)
- Reversible: can be deleted if setup changes
- Why it works: `.local/bin` is checked before the global npm bin directory

**Why:** The broken @anthropic-ai/claude-code npm global install was being found by `claude.cmd` calls in tests. Uninstalling it alone would break `claude.cmd`. The shim ensures continuity without re-installing via npm.

**How to apply:** Recognize this shim as a forward-compatibility bridge. It will handle all `claude.cmd` calls transparently. No manual intervention needed unless reverting the setup.
