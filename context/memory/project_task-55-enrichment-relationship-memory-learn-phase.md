Task 55 (pattern detection in agent loops) should incorporate two new input types beyond pattern detection:
- **RELATIONSHIP memory**: assistant's notes about the collaboration itself (what frustrated the user, what communication style landed better, how the user reacted to different approaches) — distinct from persona, which captures how the user works generally
- **Explicit learn phase**: deliberate reflection-to-memory at task end, per PAI's seven-phase loop model

Feeds from three convergent systems: ruflo's trajectory tracking idea + PAI's loop structure + memclaw's outcome scoring framework.

**Why:** Three independent design systems converged on capturing task retrospectives + collaboration memory, signaling this is a genuine missing piece

**How to apply:** When Task 55 is scoped, model both input types in session-end capture; plan RELATIONSHIP memory hooks alongside the existing pattern-detection slot
