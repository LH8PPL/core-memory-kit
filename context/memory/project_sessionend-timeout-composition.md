`autoPersona` default timeout is 50_000 and correctly composes with 60s ceiling across four concurrent SessionEnd Haiku calls. Timeout-composition discipline verified at all sites; recursion guard correct everywhere needed.

**Why:** Core design parameter for concurrency/timeout safety; review-validated architecture

**How to apply:** Reference when reviewing or modifying hooks/session timeout-related code
