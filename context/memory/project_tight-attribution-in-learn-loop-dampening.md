The learn-loop only dampens search ids the model actually invoked (via `mk_search`), not the entire injected snapshot. Failures unrelated to searched memory produce no dampen signal—this prevents false positives.

**Why:** A pytest error unrelated to memory recall shouldn't dampen a persona fact.

**How to apply:** When validating, expect no dampen signal if a command fails with zero in-chat searches. For a positive dampen, precede the failure with an in-chat `mk_search` that the failure then contradicts.
