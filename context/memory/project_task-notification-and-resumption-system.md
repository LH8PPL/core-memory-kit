Task notifications fire when an agent completes with no live background children. The same task-id can notify multiple times (agent may be resumed). Users can send follow-up messages to continue/resume a paused task.

**Why:** Knowing how the notification system works prevents confusion when a task-id reappears; clarifies that resumption is expected and possible

**How to apply:** When a task-id recurs in a notification, recognize it as a resumption checkpoint; send another message to continue or resume the agent
