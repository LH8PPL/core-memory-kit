Releases require end-to-end gate tests before tag/publish:
- Install on fresh environment (cold-open, brand-new project context)
- Full feature sweep (all new features exercised end-to-end)
- UX/behavior bugs caught and fixed *before* shipping
- Unknowns documented as deferred tasks for the next version (not shipped as rough edges)

v0.3.3 validation: cold-open E1 proved the differentiator; headline UX bug (decisions-scope warning) caught, fixed, verified via real install; Tasks 161–162 cleanly deferred.

**Why:** Prevents shipping half-baked features; ensures solid user experience and builds user trust in kit quality.

**How to apply:** Apply this gate before each release tag; use cold-open (fresh project) to stress-test key differentiators; defer unknowns transparently.
