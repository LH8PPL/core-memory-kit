The cut-gate test (in `C:\Temp\cut-gate16`) has discrete phases with abbreviations: **M0–M3 tools** (memory tool checks), **W1–W4 recall** (working memory retrieval), **DJ4-live/DJ6-live journal** (dirty journal and session journal live checks), **F-7b-live forget** (forget functionality live check). These are run in-chat in VS Code on the cut-gate16 directory, with prompts in the guide.

**Why:** The phases are a structured verification checklist for the memory kit's core functionality. Running them in-chat (not terminal) lets Claude Code exercise its memory integration directly.

**How to apply:** After starting VS Code on cut-gate16, follow the phase sequence from the guide; each phase is a natural-language prompt to run in Claude Code.
