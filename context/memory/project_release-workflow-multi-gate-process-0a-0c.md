claude-memory-kit uses sequential numbered gates to ensure safe releases:
- **§0a (commit)**: Commit version bumps (CHANGELOG.md, packages/cli/package.json) and push to main. Auto-captured memory files remain unstaged. No tag pushed yet.
- **§0b (build & test)**: npm pack → uninstall old global CLI → install new tarball → verify `cmk --version` shows 0.4.0 (gate G0).
- **§0c (backup)**: Back up ~/.claude-memory-kit and ~/.aws before running live tests.
- **Publish (final)**: Only after all gates pass, push git tag (e.g., `git tag v0.4.0 && git push origin v0.4.0`) to trigger publish.yml.

**Why:** Separating commit and tag ensures no publish occurs until the entire gate sequence succeeds. Clear rollback point if any gate fails.

**How to apply:** Follow gates in order. Test output at each step before advancing. Push tag only as final, deliberate action after §0c clears.
