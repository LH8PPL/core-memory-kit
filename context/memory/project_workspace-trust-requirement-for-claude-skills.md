In Claude Code, projects with a `.claude/skills/` directory require a one-time workspace-trust acceptance before permission rules take effect.

Per the docs (line 364 at code.claude.com/docs/en/settings):
> "For skills checked into a project's `.claude/skills/` directory, `allowed-tools` takes effect **after you accept the workspace trust dialog for that folder**, the same as permission rules in `.claude/settings.json`."

Until the trust dialog is accepted, the project's permission rules in `.claude/settings.json` (including `Skill()` allow-lists) are **inert**.

**Why:** This is a security model in Claude Code. The trust dialog gates all permission rules and skill load for untrusted folders, preventing execution of unreviewed code.

**How to apply:** When opening a project with `.claude/skills/` in VS Code/Claude Code, accept the "Do you trust the files in this workspace?" dialog once. After acceptance, the kit's permission rules take effect.
