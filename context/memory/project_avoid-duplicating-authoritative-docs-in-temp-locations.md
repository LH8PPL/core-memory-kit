Creating convenience reformats/checklists of authoritative docs (like `docs/process/cut-gate.md`) in temporary or scratch locations violates the project's single-source-of-truth discipline. Duplicate copies drift from the source and create maintenance burden.

**Why:** Only the authoritative doc is maintained; duplicates become stale and can mislead future sessions.

**How to apply:** Keep reformats truly temporary (unsaved), or link directly to the authoritative source. Do not commit or cache parallel versions.
