SKILL.md descriptions must be formatted as YAML block scalars (not plain strings). This is enforced by `validate-skill-sources.mjs` using strict `js-yaml` parsing. Both existing SKILL.md files were updated to comply (PR #220). The linter runs on every `npm test` and `npm run lint:skill-sources`.

**Why:** Block scalars are the correct YAML format for multi-line text. Using plain strings breaks strict YAML validation.

**How to apply:** When creating or editing SKILL.md files, ensure descriptions use block scalar syntax (e.g., `|` for literal blocks or `>` for folded blocks), not quoted strings.
