The embedding_cache stores vector representations of fact file bodies (used for semantic search), NOT the facts themselves. Fact files are stored independently in context/memory/. When cache is wiped (e.g., during leak reproduction), the 1451+ fact files survive completely intact; only cached vectors need recomputing. Cache rebuilds automatically on next semantic search/sweep with expected slowness on first query.

**Why:** Clarifying this separation prevents mistaking cache loss for memory loss and explains expected performance degradation during cache rebuilds.

**How to apply:** If a session experiences slow semantic search after cache clear, know it is normal and self-healing. Cache loss does NOT mean data loss.
