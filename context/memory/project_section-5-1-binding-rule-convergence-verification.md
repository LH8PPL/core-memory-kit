Research findings that converge across multiple projects do not constitute verification of current state. Before implementing code based on prior research, verify critical claims against primary sources.

**Example:** Task 50 documented two projects' Cursor integrations; Task 196 required fresh verification of Cursor's current docs (hooks schema, MCP payloads, rules system) *before* first code edit. This caught the Memories-removal change that the research base missed.

**Why:** Prevents bugs from stale/incomplete secondary sources. Secondary research provides direction; primary sources catch recent changes and edge cases.

**How to apply:** At lane/task start, if it depends on prior research, fetch fresh primary docs/APIs/sources before first code edit. Allow a short verification cycle (1–2 doc fetches, as done for Task 196).
