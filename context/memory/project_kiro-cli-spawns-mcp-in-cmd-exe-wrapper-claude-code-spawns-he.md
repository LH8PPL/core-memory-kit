- kiro-cli launches MCP via `cmd.exe /C cmk mcp serve` — because cmk is a .cmd/.ps1 shim, a visible shell window opens and persists
- Claude Code spawns MCP as a headless child process (no window)
- The architectural difference between launchers is the root cause; not a code defect

**Why:** Understanding the spawn mechanism directs the fix strategy — it's a launcher integration problem, not an MCP problem

**How to apply:** When debugging kiro-cli-specific MCP issues, first check the spawn mechanism (cmd.exe wrapper vs headless), not just the MCP code itself
