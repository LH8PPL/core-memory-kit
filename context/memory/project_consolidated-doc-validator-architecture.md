Four independent validators (`validate-references`, `validate-doc-registry`, `validate-doc-completeness`, `validate-index-completeness`) merged into one `scripts/validate-docs.mjs`, driven by `DOCUMENTATION-MAP.md`.

The four validators are now **families** within the single script (reduced validator count from 21 to 18).

New two-direction check in `registry` family: flags both unregistered files AND stale registry entries pointing to non-existent files.

Back-compat: legacy `<!-- validate-references: ignore -->` marker honored forever; no existing doc edits required.

**Why:** D-249 required separating judgment (what to check) from machinery (how to check). This consolidation unified the judgment layer into one per-change walk while keeping overlapping machinery as four families.

**How to apply:** Treat `scripts/validate-docs.mjs` as the canonical doc validation entry point. When adding new doc validators, consider whether they fit as a new family inside this script.
