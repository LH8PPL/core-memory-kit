The `live-test.mjs` harness hardcodes `claude` CLI calls and runs on the developer's machine (which has Claude Code installed).

This means it **passes while the bug remains hidden** — it can't simulate or detect that Cursor/Kiro users without Claude Code would fail silently.

**Why:** The harness was designed only for Claude Code. It can't test multi-agent scenarios where a target agent doesn't have its assumed dependencies.

**How to apply:** Future testing should either mock/simulate missing `claude` CLI for Cursor/Kiro paths, or test on a machine where Claude Code is NOT installed. Do not rely on the current harness to validate agent-specific readiness.
