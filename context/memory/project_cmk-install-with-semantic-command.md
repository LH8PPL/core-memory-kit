`cmk install --with-semantic` enables semantic search in a project.

Run from project folder. Scaffolds:
- `context/` directory structure
- Git hooks
- MCP server registration
- Local embedder (~260 MB)
- Search mode: hybrid (semantic + keyword)
- Pre-warms embedding model

Caveat: downloads @huggingface/transformers (pulls libvips/sharp native libs). DLL file locks may block installation, but kit gracefully falls back to keyword-only search.

**Why:** Core setup command for semantic search with documented graceful degradation on DLL lock failure.

**How to apply:** Use to enable semantic search. If blocked by DLL locks, keyword search continues working.
