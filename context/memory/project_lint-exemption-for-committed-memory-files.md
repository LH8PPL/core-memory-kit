Self-exempting `<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD013 MD041 -->` header + managed `.prettierignore` block. Ecosystem-canonical solution (used by doctoc, all-contributors for generated markdown). ~0.5–1 day, zero blast radius, zero desync risk, fixes both header comments and inline provenance.

**Why:** Memory format uses inline comments for per-bullet provenance lifecycle. Markdownlint rules MD041 + MD013 flag these. Disable-directive signals "tool-managed file" (standard in ecosystem) and aligns with how other projects handle generated markdown.

**How to apply:** Add disable-comment as first line of generated memory files. Add Prettier ignore block. Test against CI linters (markdownlint, Prettier).
