When Claude Code's MCP server becomes stale (serving pre-fix code), restart the tool with `/exit` followed by `claude`. This closes the stale MCP server and reconnects, reloading updated code without a full session restart.

**Why:** MCP servers can drift out of sync mid-session, causing queries to fail against pre-fix code even though the fix is deployed. Quick restart avoids confusion when debugging apparent regressions.

**How to apply:** If a query works in CLI but fails in the MCP tool, check whether the MCP server is stale and restart with `/exit` then `claude`.
