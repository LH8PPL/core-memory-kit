Task 237 automates the full advisory response loop: scan for vulnerabilities, file a GitHub issue if found, auto-close when the dependency is fixed. The chain was live-verified end-to-end in this cycle by manually dispatching against main (unfixed version), generating the issue, then merging the fix and confirming auto-close executes.

**Why:** Automation chains can silently break at any stage (scan finds nothing, issue doesn't file, auto-close doesn't trigger). Live testing before the fix merges catches these gaps.

**How to apply:** When shipping a dependency fix, manually trigger the scan against the unfixed version to exercise the entire flow (scan → file → merge fix → auto-close) once.
