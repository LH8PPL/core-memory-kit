The global repack workflow (used during release finalization, e.g., v0.5.0 tag) requires terminating all `cmk mcp serve` processes first. Leaving them running breaks the reinstall step.

**Why:** Prior incident: a repack was attempted with mcp serve procs still active, causing install failure.

**How to apply:** Before running repack as part of tag finalization, explicitly kill `cmk mcp serve` processes (e.g., `pkill -9 cmk` or platform equivalent). Verify termination before proceeding.
