Kiro CLI stores hooks inside individual agent configs (~/.kiro/agents/<agent>/config → hooks{}), not at project level. Hooks only fire when the agent is active.

To enable automatic memory without requiring --agent flag each session, chat.defaultAgent must be set globally to the memory-kit agent.

This creates a cascading requirement: hooks in agent scope → agent must be default → default setting is global-only → agent must be global.

Verified universal across shipping Kiro memory tools (2026-06-20 research).

**Why:** Explains why claude-memory-kit's Kiro implementation requires a global agent; this is a structural constraint, not a design choice

**How to apply:** When working with Kiro memory features, assume no project-level hook file exists; all hooks must be agent-scoped and gated by default-agent settings
