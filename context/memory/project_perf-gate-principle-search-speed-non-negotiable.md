The kit's search latency cannot be traded for install-time UX improvements. User's decision framework:
- Acceptable: one-time friction during setup (npm install, binding prompts)
- Not acceptable: permanent per-query overhead (any runtime regression on hot paths)
- Operational gate: node:sqlite p95 ≤ better-sqlite3 p95 × 1.03 per gated read path (3% is harness noise floor, not a perf budget)

**Why:** User stated search is foundational to the kit's purpose; any permanent slowdown defeats the kit's value. This discipline parallels prior bake-offs (D-109 embedder choice).

**How to apply:** When evaluating storage/dependency trade-offs, always bench hot paths (FTS5 query, vec cosine, per-read reindex) end-to-end. If regression on p95 > 0%, the choice fails — no budget.
