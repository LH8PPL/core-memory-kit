After global upgrade, confirm all columns pass: existing search/sqlite/vec0 work, new features appear (date column 4→5 fields, new CLI verbs like cmk tour/expand), scaffold drift resolves (HC-9 FAIL→PASS), scaffolding files created (.claude/commands/tour.md), backend wired (hybrid semantic, claude-code). Zero regression in priors.

**Why:** v0.6.0 introduced new features and fixed issues; matrix catches breakage early in upgrade path.

**How to apply:** Run checklist after each global upgrade before advising users.
