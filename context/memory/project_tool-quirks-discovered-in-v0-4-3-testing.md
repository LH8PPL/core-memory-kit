- **Rich flag vs bare remember** (PR1): Using bare `remember` does not trigger the recurrence-promotion path; requires the rich flag to be set.
- **init-user-tier prerequisite** (PR4): The no-`--to` promotion flow expects `init-user-tier` to run first; fails without it.
- **Zero-width Unicode in cmk remember** (PR5): Passing zero-width Unicode to `cmk remember` causes exit code 2 with no output written (not a crash, intended safety behavior).

**Why:** These are non-obvious behaviors discovered under live testing; future workflows or gate checks need to account for them.

**How to apply:** Document these in test fixtures and gate probes. When adding remember-like features, check for the rich-flag requirement.
