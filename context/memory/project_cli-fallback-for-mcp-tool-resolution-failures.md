When MCP tools don't resolve via ToolSearch (e.g., `mcp__cmk__*` tools unavailable), the CLI fallback path works as a verified workaround. This unblocks progress when MCP connectivity is temporarily broken and allows testing/validation to continue.

**Why:** Provides an alternative path for testers and developers when tool resolution fails. Enables forward momentum even during activation troubleshooting.

**How to apply:** Use the CLI fallback when MCP tools are unavailable. Document it as a working alternative path, especially for testers/troubleshooters who may not have completed activation setup yet.
