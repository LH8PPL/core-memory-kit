Fix for v0.3 FTS5 crash via `prepareFtsQuery(raw)` helper in search.mjs, applied to `opts.query` before keyword search calls.

Approach:
- Tokenize user input on whitespace
- Quote tokens containing special chars (dots, hyphens) or reserved words (AND/OR/NOT, case-sensitive)
- Escape embedded `"` as `""` (SQL-style)
- Leave already-quoted phrases as-is
- Pass plain words through
- Rejoin with spaces

**Why:** Per-token quoting preserves implicit-AND between words (better recall for multi-word queries like "layered architecture"), while whole-query quoting forces strict phrase matching. Grounded in SQLite FTS5 primary docs.

**How to apply:** Write helper in search.mjs; apply as preprocessing before runKeywordSearch and runTranscriptKeywordSearch. Error path remains as fallback for unparseable queries.
