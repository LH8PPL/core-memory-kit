Manual rituals like `/close-day` are forbidden. Capture, distill, and promote must be automatic (cron, Stop hook, backfill) — never depend on human discipline or ritual compliance.

**Why:** Manual rituals are fragile; design should self-correct instead of relying on users to remember to run commands.

**How to apply:** New features requiring user commands should be optional UX, never the critical path. Prefer auto-triggered or scheduled.
