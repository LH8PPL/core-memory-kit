- **Pattern:** Give the agent retrieval as a tool it *chooses* to invoke (judgment-pulled), not auto-injected every turn.
- **Confidence boost:** The ML Mastery article on memory frameworks explicitly contrasts "memory as tool" vs auto-retrieve; frames memory-as-tool as a recognized architectural choice, not a workaround.

**Why:** Our Task 149 "when-to-recall" fork (judgment-pulled vs always-search) is validated by external literature as a deliberate design pattern, suggesting the approach is sound and positions us alongside best practices.

**How to apply:** Task 149: This confirms the judgment-pulled `memory-search` skill as the right architectural lever; continue design in that direction.
