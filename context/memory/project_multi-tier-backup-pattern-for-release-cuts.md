When cutting a release with path/tier migrations, maintain three independent backups:
  - Pre-rename snapshot (dated, e.g., `23_v0.5.4_rename_cut-gate/`)
  - Pre-gate-moved copy (e.g., `~/.core-memory-kit.pre-gate-moved`)
  - Earlier historical backup

**Why:** Structural changes (path renames, tier migrations) risk persona corruption. Three tiers enable full recovery if gate validation fails.

**How to apply:** Before starting a release cut, back up the user tier (old or new path) into three locations with clear version labels; archive, don't overwrite.
