The design question "Can Kiro support project-local agents?" was resolved: **No**.

Findings from 10-case test matrix (D-284, D-283):
- Project-local `.kiro/agents/` files don't auto-activate; kiro-cli uses built-in default
- Automatic memory requires global `chat.defaultAgent: cmk` setting
- Current global-only design is correct and vindicated

**Why:** Permanently settles whether Kiro can match Claude Code's project-local model. Empirical evidence prevents future re-litigation of this design choice.

**How to apply:** Configure Kiro agents only via global `chat.defaultAgent`. Do not attempt project-local placement as a shortcut.
