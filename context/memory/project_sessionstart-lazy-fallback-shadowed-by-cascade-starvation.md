SessionStart floor designed to trigger daily distill if cron fails (D-105 mitigation). On busy repo, "stale-now" verdict permanently shadows "stale-daily", so fallback only does session roll, never daily distill.

**Why:** Second safety net is broken — system has no backup when nightly cron dies

**How to apply:** Modify lazy roll to also trigger daily/weekly distill, not just session roll; unblock cascade-starvation (D-105)
