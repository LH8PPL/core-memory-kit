All cut-gate issues resolved and merged:
- Learn-loop (Tasks 190-193) shipped
- Privacy screen (Task 148) shipped with 3-reviewer hardening
- D-300 cold-open embedder false-positive note fixed

Verification status:
- E1 (wedge): PASS — exemplary; user's project habits immediately recognized (uv/ruff/venv)
- E2 (privacy containment): PASS — L1 real-time name masking confirmed, git add correctly blocks unscreened transcripts
- E2 (privacy promotion): PENDING — need live demonstration of L3 judge masking real names to «NAME» markers in committed session transcript

Queued for v0.5.1:
- Distill starvation defect
- Incremental-resumable principle defect

**Why:** Release is one gate away from tagging. Next session needs exact status to know what remains and what's next.

**How to apply:** To close L3 gate: trigger promotion (user choice: continue existing session OR fresh cold-open), verify committed date.md shows masked names, tag v0.5.0, then begin v0.5.1 defect work.
