Handler tests have a recurring blind spot where error/exit branch coverage in seam-injection scenarios is not exercised by unit tests.

Observed pattern:
- Task 143: handlers had untested error/exit branches
- Current task: same pattern identified and fixed

Unit tests initially miss these paths; gaps are caught by live-test or skill-review runs.

**Why:** This systematic gap risks incomplete coverage and repeated discovery cycles. Recording the pattern prevents future handler-task rework.

**How to apply:** When writing handler tests (especially seam-injection), explicitly verify error/exit paths are tested. Flag this as a known gap to check during handler test review.
