- **Tier 1** (gold standard): Vetted adjacent peers (claude-mem, mem0, Letta, Graphiti) for direct architecture comparison.
- **Tier 2** (mechanism refs): Canonical sources for scheduled-job problem (logrotate, anacron, Postgres, SQLite).
- **Tier 3** (new finds): Exploratory sources discovered during research (e.g., OpenWolf).

**Why:** Clarifies how research sources are evaluated and prevents conflating peer architecture with mechanism precedent with novelty.

**How to apply:** Declare which tier each research source belongs to upfront. Tier 1 for architecture validation, Tier 2 for mechanism grounding, Tier 3 for edge cases/novelty.
