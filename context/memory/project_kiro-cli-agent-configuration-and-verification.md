- Agent configuration path: `~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json`
- When properly loaded, default agent resolves to `cmk` (not `kiro_default`)
- D-198 fix involved ensuring this file is loaded and hooks execute correctly
- Verification method: probe logs from `agentSpawn` and `preToolUse` hooks confirm loading and hook execution

**Why:** Configuration location and verification approach are essential for kiro-cli agent setup debugging and fix validation

**How to apply:** When troubleshooting kiro-cli agent resolution, check `~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json` and use hook probe logs to verify the fix
