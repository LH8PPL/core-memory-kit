**Validates:** MCP tools, CLI verbs, health checks, agent profiles. **Deliberately excludes:** hook counts (too generic; false positive risk outweighs coverage). Hook-count drift remains a human review judgment call. This mirrors the pattern of glossary hook-count errors sitting undetected for months.

**Why:** Assistant explained this as intentional design: some validation gaps are safer left to human judgment than caught by brittle automation.

**How to apply:** Expect that generic nouns (like "hooks") require manual review; automation reliably covers named, countable tools and verbs.
