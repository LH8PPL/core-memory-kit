All prompts must be sanitized using `sanitizePrivacyTags` + `maskPii` BEFORE any use (search queries, logging, indexing). Private-tagged content must never reach disk or indices; the sanitized prompt becomes the source of truth for all downstream operations. Regression test captures the privacy breach reproduction (raw prompt with PII landing in `recall.log`).

**Why:** Task 233 implementation logged raw prompts to disk, leaking `<private>` content (including PII/SSN). Violates the kit's privacy contract.

**How to apply:** When handling user prompts, sanitize as first step. Reference Task 233 fix as canonical implementation pattern.
