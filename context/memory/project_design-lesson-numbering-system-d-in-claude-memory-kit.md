Project uses D-### numbered patterns to reference prior design decisions and apply them consistently:
- **D-125**: Reuse principle — route through shared safe paths rather than re-implement safety mechanisms
- **D-120**: Surface-scoped precedent — testing scope should match actual code surface (e.g., stress-test only for concurrency/spawn/hook surfaces, not pure file IO)
- **D-51**: Class for username/path leaks — absolute paths and credentials in error output / logs

**Why:** Project code reviews and PR descriptions reference these patterns to justify design choices; helps understand vocabulary and decision-tracing

**How to apply:** When reading code comments or PR bodies referencing D-###, recognize as references to documented design lessons; future sessions should know this shorthand
