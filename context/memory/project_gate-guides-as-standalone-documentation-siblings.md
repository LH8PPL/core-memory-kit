Gate documentation exists as three independent guides:
- `cut-gate-claude-code.md` (Claude Code variant)
- `cut-gate-kiro.md` (Kiro IDE variant)
- `cut-gate-kiro-cli.md` (kiro-cli variant)

Each is self-contained with no cross-references to the others, despite following similar structure and validating the same agent/memory system. Content is duplicated where needed rather than centralized.

**Why:** Modularity ensures users can follow ONE gate variant without needing to understand or reference the others. Each guide is a complete, independent resource.

**How to apply:** When creating new gate variants, maintain the parallel, standalone structure. Duplicate shared content (validation steps, glossary, checks) rather than cross-referencing.
