cut-gate20 uses a hierarchical gate verification system with two phases:

**Pre-Session checks (§0-§1):** G0 (version), G1+BK1 (doctor/backend), G2 (memory-write safe), G2b (memory-search read-only), G3 (CLAUDE.md slim), G4 (leak detection—3 tiers), G5 (hooks+allow-list), G6 (MCP registered), G7 (semantic hybrid), BK1-BK4 (backend gates incl. kiro-cli + cursor-agent compression).

**Post-Session checks (§3):** capture-verification file checks (did auto-extract fire, preference shape/trust, backend-relative auto-extract, no leaks).

**Why:** Project requires reliable verification that the live Claude Code session environment is safe, captures are correct, and no sensitive data leaked.

**How to apply:** Before running any live session, run all §0-§1 gate checks. After a session completes, run §3 capture checks. Fix any failures before proceeding.
