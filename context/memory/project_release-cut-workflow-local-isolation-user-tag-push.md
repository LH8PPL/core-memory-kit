Standard release workflow:
1. Run `npm run release -- <VERSION>` locally (generates commit, updates package.json + CHANGELOG)
2. Build tarball from release commit
3. Install and test tarball in isolated sandbox (not dev repo, not user's personal install)
4. Run full gate suite on real tarball
5. If all gates pass, confirm readiness
6. User manually pushes tag: `git tag <VERSION> && git push origin <VERSION>`

**Why:** Real tarball testing catches issues dev repo would miss; isolation prevents accidents; user controls final tag

**How to apply:** For next release, follow exactly; never test on dev repo; never push tags from assistant
