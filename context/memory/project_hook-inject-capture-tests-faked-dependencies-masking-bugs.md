Unit tests for routing/inject/capture have relied on faked dependencies (non-existent fields, dropped edit content). This masked D-269 (Kiro empty snapshot since v0.4.0) and afterFileEdit (wired-but-dead code) until live-test and skill-review caught them during PR #254.

**Why:** Mocks create false test confidence. Real bugs only surface when the full integration stack runs.

**How to apply:** When testing hook/inject/capture plumbing, always use real injector and real file-edit flow. Lock findings with integration tests.
