SonarCloud flags `then` as a field name under its `then`-in-object rule. The rule is legitimate (accidental thenables break Promise chains), but in Kiro's schema, `then` is just a field name, not a thenable. Fix: use bracket notation (e.g., `schema[then]` instead of `schema.then`) — result is byte-identical output.

**Why:** This rule fires reliably on any field named `then`. Without knowing it's a false positive in this context, developers may over-fix or be confused by the flag during CI.

**How to apply:** When SonarCloud flags `then`-in-object in future PR checks, if it's a schema field: apply bracket-notation refactor and verify byte-identical output. Sonar will re-pass.
