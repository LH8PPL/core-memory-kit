Research across claude-mem, mem0, Letta, Graphiti: all use event-driven synchronous consolidation on **Stop hook (session END)**, not SessionStart.

Kit architecture mirrors this:
- SessionEnd `compress-session` hook: 60s ceiling, user not waiting → room for synchronous Haiku
- SessionStart: 30s ceiling, user waiting → not ideal for synchronous work

**Validated pattern:** Synchronous consolidation at END (event-driven, no blocker) + detached floor at START (reliable backstop when END didn't fire) = correctness without user-facing latency.

**Why:** Resolves tension between Q4 ("correctness over speed") and live-test ceiling conflict. Peers validate this works; kit already has the SessionEnd infrastructure.

**How to apply:** Next decision: synchronous consolidation uses existing SessionEnd hook; SessionStart uses existing detached path as reliable floor (post-167.A cron-liveness fix).
