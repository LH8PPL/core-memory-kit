DJ4 tests whether Claude autonomously reaches for `--scope decisions` when answering decision-history questions. **Test outcome: the feature works.** Claude correctly invoked `cmk search --scope decisions` when asked "what made us switch [from broadcast to SDK]?". The empty result was due to stale MCP process (D-80), not a feature defect. Current build (Jun 17 11:12) has correct zod enum validation + search scope support.

**Why:** DJ4 is the headline verification for v0.3.3. Confirms feature design is sound; infrastructure gotcha does not block the tag.

**How to apply:** Re-test after restarting Claude Code to confirm decision-scope recall works end-to-end.
