Claude Code documentation specifies two forms for Skill permission rules:
- Exact match: `Skill(name)` (e.g., `Skill(memory-write)`)
- Wildcard match: `Skill(name *)` with a **SPACE**, not a colon (e.g., `Skill(memory-write *)`)

The colon form `Skill(name:*)` is valid in Bash/PowerShell but NOT in Claude Code permission rules. Task 169 shipped with `Skill(memory-write:*)` (colon), which may not match correctly.

**Why:** The docs at code.claude.com/docs/en/permissions definitively show the space form. Using the wrong syntax could explain why permission rules appear present but still prompt.

**How to apply:** When fixing or writing Skill rules, use `Skill(name *)` with a space. Verify against official docs if uncertain.
