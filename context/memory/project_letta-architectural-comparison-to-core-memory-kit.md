Letta (GitHub: letta-ai/letta) is an LLM operating system addressing memory hierarchy + agentic recall—same problem space as kit, different architectural bets.

**Three-axis comparison:**
- **Where it sits**: Letta = agent runtime (agents built inside); kit = plugin for existing agents (Claude Code, Kiro, Cursor, Codex)
- **Memory substrate**: Letta = DB-backed server-side (rows + vector store); kit = markdown in repo (git-native, human-readable)
- **Write path**: Letta = agent self-edits memory; kit = screened writes (secrets/PII/injection gates), provenance, conflict queue

Cited 74× in kit research base. Deep code read initiated 2026-07-19.

**Why:** Closest shipped sibling in memory-hierarchy design space. Architectural contrast directly informs kit design decisions and risk assessment.

**How to apply:** Use three-axis framework for positioning new systems. Reference Letta when evaluating kit runtime vs. plugin architecture or memory substrate strategy.
