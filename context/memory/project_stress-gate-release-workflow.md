Changes must pass a stress-testing gate before landing in this project:
- Freeze the repo (block writes)
- Run stress suite 5 times (5x all-green required)
- Only after all stress passes: commit → PR → merge → retro
- No repo writes allowed until stress gate completes

**Why:** Validates concurrency safety and robustness before changes are merged; part of the project's release quality standard

**How to apply:** When landing a fix or feature, wait for stress gate to complete before committing; don't bypass this gate
