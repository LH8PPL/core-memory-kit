Whether a `q_cli_default.json` file exists in `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/` **before** running the gate determines:
- **KG1 expectation:** whether to expect a "you already have a Kiro default agent" note or silent-default path
- **Restore behavior:** whether the restored `q_cli_default.json` is left (user's existing file) or deleted (ours from the capture)
- This single fact is critical for deciding post-gate cleanup and recovery steps

**Why:** The capture/restore logic is conditional on pre-gate state; the guide needs users to record this fact in NOTES.md

**How to apply:** Always check and document `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/*.json` presence in NOTES.md before gate starts; use that to decide which restore path to take later
