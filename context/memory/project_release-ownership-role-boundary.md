- Merge to main, release cut (version bump), and npm/GitHub publish are **user-driven** actions
- Assistant provides step-by-step instructions and confirms all release gates passing
- Assistant does NOT execute merge, publish, or push tags
- Maintains clear responsibility and traceability for production changes

**Why:** Ensures transparency and user control over outward-facing actions (npm publish, GitHub Release, git tags); prevents accidental commits to wrong branch or publishing wrong version

**How to apply:** When release ready, provide shell commands and gate review; user executes all git/npm commands; assistant reviews outputs and confirms success
