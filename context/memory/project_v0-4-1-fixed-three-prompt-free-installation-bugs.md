- **Bug 169** (CC 2.1.x skill form): Skill gate syntax was correct, but Claude Code 2.1.x's permission prompt form changed; gate expected old form
- **Bug 170** (`--with-semantic` EBUSY): Trusted npm's exit code incorrectly; should validate the actual import, not just exit 0
- **Bug 171** (MCP wildcard collapse): `mcp__cmk__*` wildcard rules stopped auto-approving in CC 2.1.x; CC tightened per-tool security

**Why:** None of these three breaks are visible to unit tests (they require live Skill prompts or real locked-DLL installs). The cut-gate found them by live testing; they drove D-209/210/211 and Tasks 169/170/171.

**How to apply:** When verifying a new CMK release, use the fresh-folder + live test workflow (see separate fact). These three are merged and won't regress, but understanding them prevents similar misses.
