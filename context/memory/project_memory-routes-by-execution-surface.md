Three distinct memory paths exist:
- **Claude Code** → MCP tools (`mk_remember`) — fully working
- **Kiro IDE** → MCP tools — fully working
- **kiro-cli** → Hooks (automatic) + CLI (`cmk search`, `cmk remember`) — automatic works; explicit saves flaky

**Why:** Execution contexts differ in capabilities. kiro-cli cannot reliably use MCP but captures memory via shell hooks.

**How to apply:** Route memory operations by surface. Document kiro-cli gaps. Rely on automatic hook capture for kiro-cli; explicit CLI is a known limitation.
