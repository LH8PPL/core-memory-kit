When uncertain about Kiro 1.0 hook file format, create a hook via the Kiro IDE UI (using the "Creating hooks in 1.0" flow) and examine the generated file in `.kiro/hooks/`. This yields canonical values for:
- `version` field (v1 or v2)
- `trigger` field names and values
- `action` shape (`{type:"command", command}` etc.)
- Matcher field structure
- Session-end/Stop trigger existence

**Why:** Documentation may be incomplete or out of sync with actual implementation. Reading what the tool itself writes is authoritative.

**How to apply:** When format questions arise, generate a minimal artifact via the IDE UI rather than guessing from docs. Examine the file it produces.
