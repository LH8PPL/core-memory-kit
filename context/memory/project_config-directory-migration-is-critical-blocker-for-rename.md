The constant `~/.claude-memory-kit/` (tier-paths.mjs:112) points to users' real on-disk memory directories. Renaming this to `~/.core-memory-kit/` without a migration path orphans all existing users' cross-project personas. Migration must read the old directory if the new one is absent, or perform a one-time move on upgrade. This is the single highest-risk line in the entire change.

**Why:** Real users exist with committed memory. A blind text swap silently breaks their setup.

**How to apply:** Before executing tier 3, design and test the config directory migration. This gates the whole v0.5.4 rename.
