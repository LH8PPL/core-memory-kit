The global `cmk` command continues to use the old artifact after code is merged to main. Must explicitly uninstall and reinstall from the freshly-packed tarball to get the updated code.

**Why:** npm maintains a local cache of global packages; merging to main does not trigger automatic re-installation

**How to apply:** After any code merge intended for global use, always rebuild and reinstall the global package before testing
