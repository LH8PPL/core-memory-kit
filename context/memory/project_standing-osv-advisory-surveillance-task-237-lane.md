Task 237 establishes a standing watch for upstream advisories that publish *after* a PR lands but before it reaches the repo. Example incident: body-parser and protobufjs advisories published between sessions, caught by standing osv-scan on 2026-07-21. Both bumped, audit clean.

**Why:** Advisory publication is asynchronous and can break main post-merge. Standing surveillance is required because one-time checks miss post-merge arrivals. This incident is hard evidence for Task 237's v0.6.2 scope.

**How to apply:** Maintain standing osv-scan in CI or routine tooling. Treat advisory bumps as standing maintenance, not one-time fixes.
