The memory kit follows a phased approach where Phase 1 (judgment, corrections, trust scoring) ships observe-only as v0.5.0, and Phase 2 (wiring trust scores into ranking via task 194) ships as v0.5.1 after real-world validation. In Phase 1, signals are logged to `trust-signals.log` but do NOT affect search ranking. Task 194 will blend these signals into BM25 ranking.

**Why:** Prevents silent steering failures on day 1. Sensors run unobserved first, creating a baseline. If judge detection misfires, the issue is visible in logs before ranking is affected. Also: task 194 is the highest-stakes surface and should not ship at fatigue peaks.

**How to apply:** Release v0.5.0 now. Dogfood this repo for days, inspect `trust-signals.log` for sane deltas and no anomalies. Use that empirical evidence as the gate criteria for 194.
