Once both PR gates (CI + skill-review) pass clean and all check-runs are enumerated and green, merge is automatic under "standing autopilot." No manual merge action required.

**Why:** Reduces toil in the final merge step; keeps PR workflow smooth and predictable.

**How to apply:** When a core-memory-kit PR reaches this state (all gates green), expect automatic merge. No reviewer action required to trigger it.
