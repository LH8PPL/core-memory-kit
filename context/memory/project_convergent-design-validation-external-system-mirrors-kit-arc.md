On 2026-06-10, an external published memory system ("I Built the Best Claude Memory System — Beats Hermes") independently arrived at the same three-tier waterfall architecture the kit finalized the same day:
- Injection + memsearch-style recall + curated answer (Hermes → hybrid search → GBrain)
- Same building blocks and fact-extraction pattern

Developed in parallel; convergence was not derived from kit.

**Why:** Independent validation of the design reduces architectural risk and confirms the waterfall pattern is sound. Proof point for stakeholders and defense against mono-search proposals.

**How to apply:** Reference in design reviews when justifying the waterfall pattern. Use to explain why the architecture was chosen.
