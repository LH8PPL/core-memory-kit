Never dismiss a test failure as "flaky" without investigation. Every failing test must be root-caused. Intermittent test behavior indicates an underlying bug or environment issue, not a valid reason to ignore the failure.

**Why:** Prevents real bugs from hiding behind flakiness claims; maintains test suite integrity and confidence.

**How to apply:** When a test fails (stress gate or otherwise), always investigate. Document the root cause. Do not skip investigation.
