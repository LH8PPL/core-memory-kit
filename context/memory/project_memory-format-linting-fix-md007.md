The provenance comment format trips **markdownlint rule MD007** (indented code as list item), not the assumed MD013/MD033/MD041 stated in current docs.
- **Fix:** Create committed `context/.markdownlint.json` disabling MD007 (optionally MD012/MD034)
- **Scope:** markdownlint auto-applies per-directory configs; exemption stays in `context/`, never touches user's root config
- **Prettier:** Add `context/` entry to `.prettierignore`
- **Docs correction:** CLAUDE.md claims format "trips MD041/MD013"—should say MD007

**Why:** Original decision (ADR-0009) was made on incomplete information. Real linter output differs from theory. This fix uses linter's intended mechanism (per-directory config), not a workaround.

**How to apply:** Implement .markdownlint.json + .prettierignore + install/uninstall wiring + test + correct CLAUDE.md. Ensures user's CI passes on kit's memory files without touching their root linter config.
