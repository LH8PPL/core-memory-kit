- **User-Visible Docs** (update when UX changes): CHANGELOG.md (fixed entries), QUICKSTART.md, CLI.md, MCP.md
- **Process Docs** (update with task/gate/release milestones): cut-gate.md (gate steps), RELEASE-PLAN.md (task tracking), build-log.md (retrospectives), tasks.md (checklist)
- **Architecture/Design Docs** (update only for architecture/threat-model/capability changes): design.md, README, ARCHITECTURE, HEALTH-CHECKS, SECURITY, DECISION-LOG
- All doc updates validated by 21 automated validators + name-guard before release

**Why:** Guides scope for doc updates; prevents stale/orphaned docs and keeps releases coherent

**How to apply:** Categorize the task change (UX/process/architecture), update only matching doc categories, trust validator suite to catch inconsistencies
