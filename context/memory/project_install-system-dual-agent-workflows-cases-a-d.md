Four concrete use cases that define install system requirements:

**Case A: Claude Code → also Kiro (keep both)**
- Start: `cmk install` done  
- Add: `cmk install --ide kiro`  
- Result: Both `.claude/` and `.kiro/` coexist; shared `context/`; both agents work  

**Case B: Kiro → also Claude Code (keep both)**  
- Start: `cmk install --ide kiro` done  
- Add: `cmk install`  
- Result: Both configs coexist; shared `context/`; both agents work  

**Case C: Claude Code → Kiro (switch, drop Claude Code)**  
- `cmk install --ide kiro` (add Kiro)  
- Verify it works  
- `cmk uninstall` (clean Claude surface)  

**Case D: Kiro → Claude Code (switch, drop Kiro)**  
- `cmk install` (add Claude Code)  
- Verify it works  
- *(Gap: `cmk uninstall --ide kiro` currently missing)*  

Core principle: **additive + idempotent + over-mutation-safe.** Each agent's install only touches its own surfaces; never creates or clobbers the other's.

**Why:** These four cases define the practical multi-agent usage patterns users will encounter. The install system must support all of them cleanly without manual workarounds or file litter.

**How to apply:** When building or validating install logic, verify it satisfies all four cases. The discipline is: each agent only writes its own surfaces; never create or modify the other agent's files, even if absent.
