When reinstalling `@lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit` globally after merging changes, lingering `cmk mcp serve` processes lock `better_sqlite3.node`, causing EBUSY errors during npm operations.

**Workaround (run before npm operations):**
```powershell
Get-Process node -EA SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Path -like "*claude-memory-kit*" } | Stop-Process -Force -EA SilentlyContinue
```

Then proceed with rebuild:
```powershell
cd C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit\packages\cli
npm pack
npm uninstall -g @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit
npm install -g .\lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-0.4.0.tgz
```

**Why:** Windows prevents overwriting files held open by processes; native Node bindings remain locked by running interpreters even after a process "exits" if the shared object is still referenced

**How to apply:** Always kill lingering node processes (especially MCP servers) before rebuilding/reinstalling global packages with native bindings; use the filter to safely target only this project's processes
