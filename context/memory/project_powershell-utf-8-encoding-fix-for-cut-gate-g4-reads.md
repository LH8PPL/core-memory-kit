When reading seed files in cut-gate.md G4 verification (sections 0–1), set `[Console]::OutputEncoding = UTF8` before reading, then use `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText()` instead of `Get-Content` to display UTF-8 characters (·, —) correctly. Fix committed 7fabe17.

**Why:** Get-Content on Windows console displays UTF-8 middots/emdashes as mojibake characters, causing false-positive "corruption" flags during verification

**How to apply:** Apply this pattern in any cut-gate guidance that reads text files; document it so future runners don't false-flag display artifacts
