Do not decompose whole-system designs into backlog fragments (scattered tasks, deferred ADR sections, deferred decisions). The synthesis act itself must stay whole and complete.

Fragmentation loses the system view; constraints that only appear at integration scale get missed. Designs must be specified completely, once, with all wires visible.

**Why:** The decomposition pattern — turning "design the closed loop" into "wedge tasks + ADR sketches + later decisions" — is a reflexive failure mode. It prevents the design from being reviewed, challenged, or finalized as one artifact.

**How to apply:** When designing a system, keep it integrated until it's finished and reviewable. Only after the complete design is approved does work decompose into a build order.
