- Compaction-State should derive `now`/`daily`/`weekly` levels from artifact mtimes (`now.md`, `recent.md`, `today-*.md`), not persistent marker/sentinel files.
- Single exception: ONE anacron-style `cron-heartbeat` stamp (gated on age, not existence) for detecting cron-liveness.
- Rationale: markers are brittle, redundant, and create two-writer hazards.

**Why:** Artifact mtimes are durable and already integrated into the system; markers add failure modes and sync risks.

**How to apply:** When designing state-tracking modules, prefer artifact queries over persistent sentinels; use heartbeats only for signals not derivable from artifacts.
