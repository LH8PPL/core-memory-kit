- Setup: 3 vitest workers, 5 full-suite runs ≈ 18 minutes total
- Constraint: do NOT edit repo files during stress iterations (validator prerun re-runs each iteration; mid-run edits contaminate the measurement being validated)

**Why:** Baseline timing and no-edit discipline prevent measurement corruption and false signals in future stress test sessions

**How to apply:** When running stress tests, allocate ~18 minutes for 5 runs, keep working tree untouched until completion
