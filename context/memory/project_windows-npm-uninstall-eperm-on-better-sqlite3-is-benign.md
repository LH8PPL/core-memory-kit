When uninstalling npm packages with native modules (especially better-sqlite3) globally on Windows, npm warns about EPERM on the compiled .node file. This is a benign OS file-lock and does not prevent successful uninstallation or reinstallation.

**Why:** Prevents false alarms during release cuts when this warning appears.

**How to apply:** Ignore EPERM on .node files during npm uninstall -g on Windows; the package removal succeeds and reinstall will work.
