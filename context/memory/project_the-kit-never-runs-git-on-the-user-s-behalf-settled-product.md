The kit NEVER runs git on the user's behalf — settled product position, user-confirmed 2026-06-11. The offered opt-in SessionEnd auto-commit of context/ was DECLINED.

**Why:** Hooks running git would race with the user's own staging/rebases and create per-turn commit noise; on public repos, reviewing the memory diff before commit IS the privacy gate (facts about the user would otherwise publish sight-unseen). The user: 'i wouldnt want to do git commands for people automaticly.'

**How to apply:** Memory writes ride the user's normal commit batches; the visible tail at session end is expected, not a bug. Do not re-propose auto-commit without new evidence.
