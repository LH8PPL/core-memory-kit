When bash CWD drifts during operations, stray artifacts appear at `packages/cli/context/`.
These are gitignored and harmless — the cause is understood and documented to prevent future confusion.

**Why:** Prevents misidentification of artifacts as uncommitted work; documents a known benign quirk

**How to apply:** When seeing this path, check .gitignore — it is expected and harmless
