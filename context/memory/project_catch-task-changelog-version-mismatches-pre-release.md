Task tracking errors—shipped task ticked under the wrong version, changelog entry filed under the wrong version number—should be caught before shipping, not caught by user review post-release.

**Why:** User review is a safety net for high-impact issues, not a substitute for process discipline. v0.6.1 had a version mismatch caught only when the user noticed the task status.

**How to apply:** Pre-release checklist: verify task status matches the version it's ticked under, and that changelog entries are filed under the correct version section. Catch discrepancies yourself.
