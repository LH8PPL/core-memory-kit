The kit must work for users with ONLY Cursor or ONLY Kiro installed, with no Claude Code dependency.

- **Problem:** Kit currently shells out to `claude` binary → dead engine for Cursor-only/Kiro-only users
- **Solution:** Route LLM backend through each agent's own CLI (`cursor-agent -p` for Cursor, Amazon Q CLI for Kiro)
- **Status:** v0.4.5 BLOCKED until Task 200 (research + implementation) completes
- **Research gates:** Does `cursor-agent -p` work as a one-shot scriptable call? Can we pick a cheap model? Kiro headless equivalent? Recursion/deadlock risk from spawning agent CLI inside agent hook?

**Why:** Previous misalignment — assistant treated "compatible" as "hooks wire" when user meant "user without Claude Code can actually use the kit." This is a real product requirement, not theoretical.

**How to apply:** Task 200 is the unblocking step for v0.4.5. Start Cursor research (most-confirmed CLI exists), then Kiro. Do not code until research validates feasibility.
