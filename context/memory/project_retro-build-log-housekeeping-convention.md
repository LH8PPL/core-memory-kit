Retros, build-logs, and similar development artifacts are stashed during PR review and applied directly to main *after* merge, rather than committed pre-merge. This pattern keeps CI clean during review and consolidates release documentation on the merge commit.

**Why:** Separates artifact commits from code review; ensures release notes land on the merge commit, not lost in the PR history.

**How to apply:** When finalizing a release PR — stash retro/build-log → squash-merge PR → pull main → pop stash → commit artifact directly to main.
