On Windows, npm uninstall/install can trigger EBUSY (errno -4082) errors on better_sqlite3.node when a process holds the binary lock (e.g., running cmk MCP server or prior global installation).

**Key insight**: Despite the errors, the install succeeds. This is expected and harmless.

- **Verification**: Run `cmk --version` to check new version is live (e.g., 0.4.0)
- **Success signal**: Version check returning new version; errors are NOT a failure signal
- **Cleanup artifact**: npm leaves orphaned temp dirs (e.g., `.claude-memory-kit-E9AXbqc9`); safe to leave or delete

**Why:** Gate test (§0b line 60-62) warns of this pattern. Understanding it prevents false alarms on Windows systems and future gate runs.

**How to apply:** Expect EBUSY on better_sqlite3.node during npm operations on Windows. Verify success with version check, not error count. Treat cleanup temp dirs as expected artifacts.
