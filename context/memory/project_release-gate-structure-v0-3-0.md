Release process documented in `docs/process/cut-gate.md`.
- Command: `npm run release -- minor` starts the process
- Process ends with tag push
- Gate components:
  - **W1–W4 recall ladder**: headline gate (required to pass)
  - **D3**: recently changed to blocker status (was previously optional/"a shrug")
  - **SonarCloud review-marks**: pending review in their UI

**Why:** D3's promotion to required blocker is a recent change; the next release cycle must respect this gate structure.

**How to apply:** Before cutting v0.3.0 or later, follow `docs/process/cut-gate.md` top-to-bottom. Ensure W1–W4 passes and D3 does not fail.
