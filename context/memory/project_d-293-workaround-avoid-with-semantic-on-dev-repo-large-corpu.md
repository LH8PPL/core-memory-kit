Prior incident (D-293): running `cmk install --with-semantic` on this dev repo's large corpus triggered an 8.8GB memory freeze. Issue is now fixed, but the workaround remains: never re-run --with-semantic on this dev repo. Refresh the global artifact in a separate clean folder instead; gate tests run in yet another set of fresh folders.

**Why:** Prevents accidental resource exhaustion of dev environment; keeps gate work isolated and unblocking

**How to apply:** To refresh global: create new folder, `git init`, `cmk install --with-semantic`. To run gate: create another folder, init, run tests. Never mix or run `--with-semantic` on dev repo itself.
