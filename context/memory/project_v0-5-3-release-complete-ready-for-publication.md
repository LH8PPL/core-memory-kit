**Phase-2 learn-loop batch shipped** (Tasks 194–212, each two-pass reviewed, stress 5/5):
- Task 194: Confidence-gated search blend + survival gate + anti-pattern conversion
- Task 209: State-labeled recall with `[superseded]`, `[expired]`, `[retracted]` tags
- Task 211: Query state-view gate for history questions
- Task 212: `cmk stats memory-health` instrumentation

**Release status**: Committed to main (green CI), CHANGELOG `[0.5.3] — 2026-07-14`, package bumped to 0.5.3

**D-248 Minor-boundary sweep outcome** (D-334): One triggered item found — Task 195 (cross-agent name decision for Cursor + Codex) — laned into v0.5.4

**Remaining action**: User approves `git tag v0.5.3 && git push origin v0.5.3` (auto-triggers publish.yml)

**Roadmap**: v0.5.4→v0.7.0 queue ready

**Why:** Phase-2 completion milestone. Task 195 lane assignment is critical for v0.5.4 planning. D-248 sweep outcome is durable project state.

**How to apply:** On v0.5.4 start, Task 195 is pre-laned and high priority. Know that minor boundaries include a backlog-sweep step. Only user go-ahead needed for tag push (per autopilot rules).
