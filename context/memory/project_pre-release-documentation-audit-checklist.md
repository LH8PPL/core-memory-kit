10-part checklist before tagging:

1. **CHANGELOG** — version entry + status wording correct
2. **tasks.md** — all shipped tasks marked [x]
3. **DECISION-LOG** — all decisions (e.g., D-244–D-248) present
4. **design.md** — architecture sections current; behavioral changes documented (§9.2.3 for search-index behavior in v0.4.3)
5. **CLI.md** — verb list current (33 verbs)
6. **MCP.md** — tool & param counts current (11 tools, 33 params)
7. **root README** — version & links accurate
8. **npm README** — version & npm-adapted links accurate
9. **RELEASE-PLAN** — all tasks laned to versions
10. **All validators + CI** — passing

Core principle: **single-source-of-truth** — design.md is authoritative; behavioral changes (especially architectural/indexing) must be documented there.

**Why:** Catches gaps before shipping. Ensures future contributors understand system design. v0.4.3 example: 182/183 indexer fix had to be documented in §9.2.3 (indexer walks scratchpads, skips seeds) to complete the record. User's checkpoint question ("all docs updated?") catches exactly this.

**How to apply:** Run checklist before every release. When code behavior changes, update design.md immediately. Treat user's pre-release "docs updated?" as a forcing function for this audit.
