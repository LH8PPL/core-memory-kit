- wordmark.svg (light) — ink text with clay accent, 360×64
- wordmark-dark.svg — off-white/clay for dark backgrounds, 360×64
- og-image.png — 1280×640 social preview (committed, ready for web UI upload)
- og-image.svg — scalable OG image variant
All text converted to path data (font-independent; renders correctly without JetBrains Mono).

**Why:** Centralized asset location; font-independence ensures consistent rendering across platforms and social media without typeface dependencies.

**How to apply:** Reference these paths in deployment and docs. When regenerating wordmark, use path-based assets rather than text+font fallbacks.
