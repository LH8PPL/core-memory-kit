Session context is loaded at session initialization and remains frozen for all subsequent turns within that session. Turns do NOT reload context from the filesystem. To load fresh context, a new session must be started.

**Why:** Critical for validation workflows; stale context in an ongoing session skews context-sensitive tests like B3/B4 wedge. Required for honest testing of cross-project doctrine capture.

**How to apply:** When running validation workflows dependent on fresh context state, start a new session rather than reusing an existing window
