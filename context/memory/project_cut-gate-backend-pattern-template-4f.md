The canonical `cut-gate.md` has a backend section (§4f) with this structure:
- BK1–BK4 checks (specific backend validation points)
- HC-11 check
- Banner statement
- Verdict line

All other cut-gate variants (cut-gate-cursor.md, cut-gate-kiro.md, cut-gate-kiro-cli.md) should replicate this same structure, substituting each agent's real CLI commands and paths.

**Why:** Structural consistency ensures maintainability and guarantees equivalent coverage across all agent guides.

**How to apply:** Use cut-gate.md §4f as the template. Adapt command examples to each agent (e.g., `cursor-agent -p` for Cursor, `kiro-cli chat` for Kiro CLI) but keep the check sequence and verdict format identical.
