When re-packing the tarball after landing D-264, the artifact must include both the D-263 and D-264 fixes. This is the third re-pack/reinstall cycle.

**Why:** Ensures downstream installations have both fixes and maintain proper version lineage.

**How to apply:** When re-packing after landing a fix, verify that both prior and current fix IDs are included in the artifact before reinstalling.
