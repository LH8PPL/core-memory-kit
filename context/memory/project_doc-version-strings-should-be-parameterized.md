Version references in guides (e.g. tarball version, package.json matches) should use placeholders like `<version>`, `*.tgz`, or "matches package.json" rather than hardcoded numbers. This prevents docs from going stale when versions change.

**Why:** Docs go stale; the tarball example in the guide had 0.3.2 but the actual install is 0.3.3. Parameterized docs are maintenance-free.

**How to apply:** When updating guides, use version-agnostic language instead of specific version numbers.
