Kit's documented lesson U-U5PPSG7Y states: "users will not run doctor commands; failures must surface automatically." The principle is archived in the project's memory but has never been mechanically implemented. Doctor remains reactive-only, contradicting this recorded intent.

**Why:** This gap is a known design debt. It directly conflicts with an existing, documented design principle, making it clear scope for v0.6.3 work alongside the reframed task 248.

**How to apply:** Reference this principle as the north star when choosing the design fork for auto-surfacing doctor. Use it to justify why doctor failures must surface automatically rather than waiting for user action.
