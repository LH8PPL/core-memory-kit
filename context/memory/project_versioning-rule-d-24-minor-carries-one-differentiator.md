- **MINOR versions** = exactly one differentiator (a user-facing wow feature)
- **PATCH versions** = polish, fixes, and follow-ups to the current MINOR; no new differentiators

**Why:** A headline feature buried in a patch gets no visibility (nobody reads patch release notes). Each MINOR deserves clear, focused marketing and user attention.

**How to apply:** When planning a release, determine whether a feature is a new differentiator. If yes, it waits for the next MINOR (possibly by design, if dependencies exist). If no, it fits in the current PATCH cycle.
