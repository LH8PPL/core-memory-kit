- CodeQL scans `main` on every push; an alert closes when the fixed code lands on `main`, not when you publish to npm
- The npm version number and CodeQL alert status are independent concerns
- You can merge a fix to `main` (alert closes on next CodeQL re-scan) without cutting a new npm release if the fix has no user-facing behavioral change

**Why:** Clarifies the relationship between CodeQL workflow and release management; the previous entry expected alerts to auto-close but didn't explain the mechanism or its independence from npm versioning

**How to apply:** When a CodeQL alert surfaces, merge the fix to `main`—the alert will close on the next scan regardless of npm version. Only cut a new npm release if there's a user-facing change or a separate release reason.
