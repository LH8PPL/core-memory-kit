v0.6.2 is staged at commit `b4bf558`, ready to tag. Task 248 (orphaned-tier auto-recovery) timing decision pending:
- **Option A:** hold tag, build recovery into v0.6.2 → users upgrading from buggy versions get automatic cleanup in single step
- **Option B:** tag v0.6.2 now as-is, implement recovery in v0.6.3 → users need two upgrade steps

**Why:** v0.6.2 is the release target users upgrade TO from buggy versions; recovery in v0.6.2 is ideal UX but requires un-staging and rebuilding

**How to apply:** user owns this decision; next session should know this decision point is open and what each path costs
