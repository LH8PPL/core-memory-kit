**Implementation Details:**
- Modify `buildMemoryHint` in `capture-prompt.mjs` to add nudge check
- Nudge reads kit's own error logs (`extract.log`, spawn-error entries)
- Fires only on fresh failure (self-cleaning: later success clears signal)
- Message: "a kit op failed — use the troubleshooting skill"

**Skill Pattern:**
- Scaffold like `memory-write`/`memory-search` skills
- Teaches `cmk doctor` + repair workflow

**Status:** Design confirmed 2026-07-22, pending outward research + grill before implementation

**Why:** Concrete implementation anchors; ensures future work aligns with design decision confirmed this session

**How to apply:** Reference when starting Task 250 to ground implementation; use skill patterns to maintain consistency with existing kit skills
