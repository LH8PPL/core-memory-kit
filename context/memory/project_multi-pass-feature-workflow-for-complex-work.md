Complex features in this project follow a structured workflow:
- **Phase 1: Implementation** — Multi-commit development phase (docs, patterns, wiring, transcript screen, etc.)
- **Phase 2: Validation** — promoteOutcome reporting, full-suite run, sensitivity axis, validators, docs walk
- **Phase 3: Review & Merge** — Two-pass review, stress testing, PR submission, re-gate, final tag

**Why:** This structured approach appears across feature development (e.g., Task 148 spans all three phases); knowing it helps organize future multi-commit work and plan the sequence of steps.

**How to apply:** When starting a new complex feature, use this three-phase structure to organize commits, validation work, and review. Reference it when planning the next steps after initial implementation is complete.
