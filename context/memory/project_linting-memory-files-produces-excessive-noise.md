The 597 memory files in `context/` use intentional non-standard markdown formatting (HTML comments, example bullets, no heading hierarchy) that is appropriate for memory storage but would be flagged as violations by markdownlint/codespell/yamllint.

**Problem:** These linters would treat machine-generated memory as documentation and flag it heavily, producing signal-killing noise.

**Solution:** Exclude `context/`, `template/`, and transcript directories from linting, or skip markdown/spell linters entirely.

**Safe additions:** actionlint (workflows only) and ShellCheck (shell scripts only) never touch memory files—pure signal, no memory-file contact.

**Why:** Machine-generated memory has formatting constraints different from hand-authored docs. The kit deliberately ships memory templates with formatting that linters would flag. Linting them misidentifies intentional structure as violations.

**How to apply:** When adding linters, check which file types each touches. For this project, favor actionlint + ShellCheck (no memory contact) over markdownlint + codespell (heavy memory-file noise). If linting markdown, update .markdownlintignore or .codespellignore to exclude context/ and template/.
