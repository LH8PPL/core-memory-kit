The repo rule "never use Set-Content on repo files" should be extended to cover whole-file rewrites by any tool, not just PowerShell. The assistant violated this by using Python to rewrite a file, which normalized line endings and broke vitest's parser.

**Why:** Whole-file rewrites in any language/tool have the same risk — they can silently alter file structure (line endings, whitespace) in ways that break downstream tooling.

**How to apply:** Document the rule as "avoid whole-file rewrites on repo files; use targeted edits instead" and apply it project-wide. When updating a file, prefer surgical edits (lines, regions) over complete rewrites.
