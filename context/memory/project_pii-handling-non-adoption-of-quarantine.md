Poison_Guard rejects detected PII and persists nothing (redacted log line only). Do **not** build a PII quarantine storage like memclaw.

**Why:** Kit's memory lives in git repos — privacy (discard-on-sight) is higher priority than quarantine-for-review UX

**How to apply:** Keep Poison_Guard's reject-and-discard approach; do not add quarantine table or review facility
