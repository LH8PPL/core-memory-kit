User explicitly does not want gitignore modifications, transcript-commit, or related git filtering changes to the memory system going forward. This decision follows a data-loss scare that was resolved by discovering off-machine backup (Google Drive sync) was the real safety net.

**Why:** User's existing backup redundancy (Google Drive sync) already provides resilience. Adding more git-level logic post-incident introduces complexity without additional safety benefit and erodes trust after a scare.

**How to apply:** Do not propose or implement gitignore, transcript-commit, or git-filtering changes in this project's memory system. If memory safety concerns arise, suggest only truly defensive measures (e.g., delete guardrails via hooks, which operate outside git).
