Runs on `npm test`. Structurally enumerates every spawn site in the kit (child_process, execa, etc.). Prevents unreviewed new spawns from appearing.

**Why:** Acts as a gate for spawn-related security findings. When a suppression is scoped to reviewed sites, `validate-spawn-discipline` ensures no new spawns bypass review.

**How to apply:** On spawn-related Sonar findings, run `npm test`. Pass = no new spawns appeared; Fail = new spawn present, needs review before merge.
