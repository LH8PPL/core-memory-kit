A background job's completion notification cannot survive the session dying: the job is a child of the session process and dies with it, silently, and no timeout on the CHILD helps — the child is not hanging, it is gone. After ANY session interruption/resume, re-verify every background job's liveness from ground truth (process table for heavy workers, output-file mtime+size growth) BEFORE reporting it as running or waiting on it.

**Why:** 2026-07-21: a session death killed a running stress gate and a review agent; the resumed session reported both as 'running' from stale spawn records, and only the user's 'you died' surfaced it. Second instance of the fabricated-liveness class (first: the Task-235 review agent, 54 min at 0 bytes).

**How to apply:** On resume: tasklist/ps for the expected worker processes, stat the output file for size AND mtime-vs-now, and only then report state. A wait must always pair with a liveness signal the waiter verifies itself; 'no notification yet' is not evidence of progress.
