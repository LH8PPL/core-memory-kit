- **Backup:** Before testing, user renames ~/.claude-memory-kit to before-cut-gateN-.claude-memory-kit
- **Project location:** Tests run in sequential C:\Temp\cut-gateN folders (e.g., cut-gate15, cut-gate16)
- **Work split:** Assistant runs §0/§1/§4/§4c (terminal/file checks); User runs §2/§3/§4b (VS Code/manual)

**Why:** Established pattern used consistently across 15+ test runs; proven reliable

**How to apply:** For each cut-gate test cycle, user backs up real ~/.claude-memory-kit; assistant creates next-sequence C:\Temp folder and runs automated phases; user opens VS Code on that folder for manual phases
