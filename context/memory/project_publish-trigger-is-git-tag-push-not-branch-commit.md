The publish.yml GitHub Actions workflow fires ONLY when pushing a git tag matching v* (e.g., `git push origin v0.4.0`), not on regular branch commits. The release script's hint may suggest `git tag && git push origin HEAD --tags` as a combined line—ignore the `--tags` part. The gate specifies `git push origin main` (commit-only) first, then `git tag v0.4.0 && git push origin v0.4.0` (tag-only) as the final, deliberate publish step.

**Why:** The safety model depends on decoupling the ordinary commit from the publish trigger. A bundled tag+push risks publishing before all gates have run.

**How to apply:** Always push commits with `git push origin main` (no tags). Reserve `git tag v*` + `git push origin v*` for after final gate approval, as the explicit publish action.
