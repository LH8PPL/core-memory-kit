The kit uses a custom, strict lint toolchain (`validate-skill-sources`, 20 validators) that understands the SKILL.md and Kiro YAML contracts, rather than generic off-the-shelf linters (e.g., Super-Linter). The strict parser now rejects invalid SKILL.md frontmatter, catching domain-specific errors early.

**Why:** Generic linters do not understand the kit's contracts (SKILL.md structure, Kiro integration); precise, custom validators catch errors that off-the-shelf tools would miss.

**How to apply:** When adding new lint checks, extend the custom validator suite rather than adopting generic tools. Keep validators focused on the kit's specific contracts.
