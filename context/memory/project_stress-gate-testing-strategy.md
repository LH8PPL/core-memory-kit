- Gate criterion: 5× full suite runs on committed, clean tree
  - Run timing: ~149 seconds per run
  - Pass requirement: all 5 must pass before PR opens
  - Critical: machine must stay awake during gate (sleep causes false negatives)
  - Test target: detached copy of committed tree to avoid edit conflicts

**Why:** Ensures high confidence in merge; environmental artifacts like laptop sleep and clock drift can produce flaky test failures that are not real bugs.

**How to apply:** Before opening PR, initiate 5-run gate on committed tree with machine actively monitored/awake. Recognize 3-hour clock gaps in `--version` tests as sleep artifacts, not failures.
