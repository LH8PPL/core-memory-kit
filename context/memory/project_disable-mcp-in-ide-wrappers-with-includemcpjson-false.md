- Setting `includeMcpJson: false` in the IDE configuration (e.g., kiro-cli) prevents MCP server initialization and eliminates the cmd.exe popup on Windows
- Trade-off: also disables MCP-based automatic memory capture
- Workaround: memory capture falls back to `cmk remember` command (explicit) or automatic session-end hook capture (implicit)

**Why:** Some IDEs don't support MCP or users want a minimal footprint; the fix improves UX. Memory capture still works via hooks.

**How to apply:** When configuring IDE wrappers for environments without MCP, set `includeMcpJson: false` in the config. Ensure session-end hook or cmk-remember integration is in place for memory persistence.
