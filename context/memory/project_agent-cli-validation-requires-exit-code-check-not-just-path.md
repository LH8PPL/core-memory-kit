Cursor installer bug (through May 2026) could deposit Unix CLI binary under Git Bash without functional Windows support, passing PATH discovery but failing at invocation. Single source of truth: `agent --version` (or equivalent version probe) exit code. PATH-based discovery (where/which) is necessary but not sufficient.

**Why:** Silent failures (CLI present but non-functional) are worse than detection failures; exit-code validation catches misconfiguration that PATH checks miss

**How to apply:** Kit agent-detection routines should call `agent --version` and verify exit code == 0, not just check `where agent` result exists
