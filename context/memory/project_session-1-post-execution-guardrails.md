After Session 1 completes, validate three health checks:
  - **★ R1:** no black `node` window flashes at SessionStart
  - **★ R2:** no "Allow this command?" / "Use skill?" prompts during capture
  - **★ B9:** `dir context\memory\project_*.md` shows rich auto-captured facts with Why/How sections (no "remember this" artifacts)

**Why:** Confirms Stop hook and auto-memory extraction system are functioning; validates that durable facts are captured with reasoning sections

**How to apply:** After Session 1 concludes, run directory check and inspect captured memory files; ensure they contain substantive facts with Why/How reasoning, not raw command echoes
