The github.com/aws-samples/sample-kiro-cli-multiagent-development repository contains working preToolUse guardrail hooks in embedded format. Designated as canonical reference for Task 166 (V3 guardrail follow-up). Approach: clone the repo and diff AWS's working preToolUse hooks against the project's 2.9.0 implementation to determine whether issues are format differences or version-specific regressions.

**Why:** The project's V3 guardrail hooks may have format issues or be broken on 2.9.0. AWS's official working example provides a baseline for comparison to identify root cause.

**How to apply:** For Task 166 startup, save the AWS repo link. Clone it and perform side-by-side diff of preToolUse hooks against 2.9.0 implementation. Document findings as format issue vs. 2.9.0 regression.
