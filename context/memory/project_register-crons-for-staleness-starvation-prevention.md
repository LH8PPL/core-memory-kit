From C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit:
```powershell
cmk register-crons
cmk doctor    # HC-5 → PASS
```
Creates two Windows scheduled tasks:
- daily-distill: 23:00 every day
- weekly-curate: 09:00 Sundays

**Why:** Crons are the designed fix for staleness and cascade-starvation; background distill-curate cycle prevents memory degradation over time

**How to apply:** Run after v0.3.5 is installed locally; verify with `cmk doctor` HC-5 check
