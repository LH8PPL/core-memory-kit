Non-blocking tasks are deferred with explicit trigger conditions listed in `specs/tasks.md`:
  - Phase-gated triggers: "after Phase 1 ships", "after 190 ships", "when 191's judgment files exist"
  - User-signal triggers: "user asks ≥2×", "user reports confusion"
  - Event triggers: "next Sonar red", "next security batch", "2nd concurrent-agent host ships"
  - Evaluation gates: "Phase-3 go gate; re-evaluate when Phase 1 ships"

**Why:** Keeps speculative work out of the active board while ensuring deferral is visible, actionable, and not forgotten. Each condition is concrete enough to watch for.

**How to apply:** When deferring a task, assign an explicit trigger (event, user signal, or phase gate). When that condition arises, bump the task to active. When triaging, scan for tasks whose triggers have fired.
