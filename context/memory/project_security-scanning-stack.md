- **CodeQL** — static analysis (SAST)
- **osv-scanner + npm audit** — dependency scanning with hard gate on high/critical vulnerabilities
- **gitleaks + GitGuardian** — secrets detection
- **SonarCloud** — hotspot analysis
- **Dependabot** — automated dependency updates including security bumps
- **Signed npm provenance** on publish

A real CVE blocks the CI build—this isn't theater.

**Why:** The project has comprehensive, automated security coverage. Future sessions need to know what safety gates are in place and trust them.

**How to apply:** When reviewing security PRs or handling dependencies, use this stack as the single source of truth. Treat CI passing as the hard gate for merge decisions.
