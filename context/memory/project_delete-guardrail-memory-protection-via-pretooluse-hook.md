The kit wires a `preToolUse` hook (`cmk-guard-memory`) that inspects all shell commands before execution. It blocks destructive commands (`rm`, `Remove-Item`, `git clean`, `git reset --hard`, `del`, `find -delete`, `>`-truncate) aimed at memory paths:
- `context/` directories
- `~/.claude-memory-kit` persona tier
- `MEMORY.md` and `DECISIONS.md` files

When triggered, the hook exits non-zero and outputs "BLOCKED by the claude-memory-kit delete-guardrail", preventing the tool from running. Fully operational on Claude Code and Kiro IDE.

**Why:** Motivated by D-192 incident — an accidental `rm` after a `cd` deleted a repo's session/transcript memory. The guardrail makes such unintended deletions impossible.

**How to apply:** Maintainers should understand this as the kit's primary data-loss prevention layer. Users are protected by default. See Task 166 for V3 native support.
