Task 50 cross-agent seam: target Kiro CLI agent-hooks (agentSpawn=SessionStart-inject, stop=turn-end-capture) defined in .kiro/agents/<name>.json, NOT the IDE Agent-Hooks surface (file-event-centric, no session-start trigger). The Taskmaster .kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook claim was the wrong hook system. Verified against kiro.dev primary docs.

**Why:** The kit's whole inject-at-start/capture-at-turn-end model only ports to the CLI agent-hook surface; building against the IDE surface would mean no session-start trigger + an undocumented on-disk format.

**How to apply:** When building the Kiro profile, set eventMap {sessionStart:'agentSpawn', turnEnd:'stop'} and write hooks into .kiro/agents/<name>.json; MCP → .kiro/settings/mcp.json (mcpServers); steering → .kiro/steering/ (inclusion: always).
