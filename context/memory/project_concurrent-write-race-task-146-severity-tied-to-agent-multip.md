**Context:** Task 50 shipped v0.4.0 (Kiro, cross-agent adapter); Task 146 addresses real race in concurrent writes to memory files (lockless file writes → data loss risk).

**Today vs. tomorrow:**
- Today: Single agent (Claude Code) → race theoretical
- When Task 50 agents ship: Multiple writers → race actually bites

**Shipping strategy:** 146 should ship live-tested alongside concurrent-agent work. Version together on release cut (version-on-cut); do not wait for standalone 146 version.

**Why:** Timing of 146 matters for risk/urgency. It's not needed for v0.4.0, but becomes load-bearing as agent count grows.

**How to apply:** When planning agent releases (beyond Claude Code), flag Task 146 for live testing in that release cycle. Don't ship concurrent writers without 146 validated.
