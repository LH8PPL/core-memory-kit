Project-scoped MCP servers (registered in `.mcp.json`) require one-time approval in Claude Code before their tools become available. The UI initially shows "⏸ Pending approval" status.

**Why:** Claude Code enforces this security policy on all MCP servers defined in committed config

**How to apply:** On first opening a project with registered MCP servers, expect an approval prompt. Approve it to activate the tools; this is expected behavior.
