Heartbeat recorded near task START, before distill completes. If distill fails partway, HC-10 still reports PASS. Hid 5-day silent outage.

**Why:** Critical monitoring blind spot — health check meant to catch failures doesn't

**How to apply:** Modify HC-10 to cross-check recent.md freshness, not just heartbeat timestamp
