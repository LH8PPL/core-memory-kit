Claude cannot directly edit GitHub's repo "About" or "Topics" fields via API or web UI — only the repo owner can edit these fields. The workflow must be: text prepared in Claude, then manually pasted by the user via the ⚙️ gear next to "About."

**Why:** GitHub repo metadata is only editable by the owner via the web UI. This is a permissions constraint, not a Claude limitation, but it creates a two-step workflow that's easy to overlook.

**How to apply:** When updating repo metadata (About, topics, description), provide the finalized text with explicit copy-paste instructions. Make it clear that the user must manually complete the GitHub UI step.
