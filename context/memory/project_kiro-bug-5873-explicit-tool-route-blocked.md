Kiro bug #5873 prevents `mk_remember` tool calls from executing inside kiro-cli.
Workaround: route memory capture through CLI (`cmk remember`) instead.

**Why:** Tool is unavailable; CLI workaround is functional and documented.

**How to apply:** kiro-cli uses CLI route for memory capture. Document as Kiro workaround; clean up when Kiro fixes bug #5873.
