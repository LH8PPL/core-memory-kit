MCP server processes spawned at session start do not auto-update when the binary changes. A session from before an MCP build update will serve stale code to Claude until killed.

**Why:** The processes are long-lived and bound to the binary they loaded with; new sessions spawn fresh processes, but old sessions continue serving the outdated version

**How to apply:** After a major MCP/Claude Code build update, restart Claude Code or kill orphaned MCP processes (e.g., PIDs reported in earlier sessions) to ensure the next session binds to the new build
