Kiro IDE gates hooks behind a trust system, requiring "Run / Reject" prompts unless commands are pre-registered (unlike Claude Code, which auto-runs registered hooks).

**Mechanism:**
- Workspace `.vscode/settings.json`: field `kiroAgent.trustedCommands` (array)
- CLI side: `toolsSettings.shell.allowedCommands` (regex pattern, start-anchored)
- Commands scoped to kit's own: `cmk hook *`, `cmk-guard-memory`
- Implementation: `kiro-trusted-commands.mjs` writes to workspace config
- Array-union behavior: preserves user's existing trusted commands, idempotent, BOM-tolerant, refuse-to-clobber
- Integrated into `installKiro` and `uninstallKiro` surfaces

**Why:** Understanding the trust mechanism is essential for configuring Kiro hooks and avoiding "Run / Reject" prompts; the design preserves user customizations and prevents accidental overwrite.

**How to apply:** When adding new trusted commands or debugging hook behavior, use the field names and scope rules above; always anchor regexes to prevent unintended matches.
