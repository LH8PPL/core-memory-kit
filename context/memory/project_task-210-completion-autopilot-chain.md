**Task 210 status:** code, docs, HC-12, forward filter complete; 3119 tests + 14 validators all green; all 8 review findings fixed.

**Blocking gate:** stress run (5× full suite, ~13 min); prior run orphaned by restart, fresh run launched.

**Post-stress autopilot (automated):**
- Commit → PR → CI → squash-automerge → housekeeping
- Housekeeping steps: checkbox, build-log, dogfood memory flush, CI watch

**Next checkpoint:** explicit pause before Task 95 (per earlier user request).

**User override option:** skip stress wait, commit on strength of already-green suite + live tests.

**Why:** Task 210 near completion; workflow pattern (code → tests → gated-stress → autopilot → pause) is repeatable. Stress orphaning (restart-induced) is a known edge case; re-launching recovers state.

**How to apply:** After stress 5/5 passes, trigger commit → PR → automerge chain automatically. Pause visibly before Task 95. Reuse this multi-gate pattern for future similar-shaped tasks.
