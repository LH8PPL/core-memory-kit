- Test files are excluded from SonarCloud scanning (configuration changed in PR #247)
- Rationale: Security/poison-guard tests deliberately contain attack patterns, which Sonar flags as vulnerabilities
- Coverage and correctness of tests are verified structurally by separate validators (e.g., exit-doors validator), not by Sonar

**Why:** Prevents false-positive Quality Gate failures from test fixtures designed to demonstrate defenses

**How to apply:** Exclude `**/*.test.js` from Sonar analysis; use structural validators (exit-doors, unit test assertions) to verify test quality instead
