After `npm install -g .\lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-*.tgz`, run `cmk --version` and verify it outputs exactly `0.4.1`. If it outputs `0.4.0` or earlier, the global install failed or is stale — re-run `npm install -g .\lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-*.tgz`.

**Why:** Confirms the packed `.tgz` was correctly installed to the global npm scope. Failure indicates a broken install that must be fixed before proceeding.

**How to apply:** Run immediately after install. If version mismatch, troubleshoot the install (e.g., clear npm cache, verify `.tgz` exists) and reinstall before moving to backup and scaffold.
