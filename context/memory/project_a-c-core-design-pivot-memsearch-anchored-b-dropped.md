Revision from A+B+C+D (four mechanisms) to A+C as core + D deferred + B dropped.

**A (input char-cap):** PROMOTED to primary. 80k byte cap right before Haiku call, from memsearch's `MAX_PROMPT_CHARS`. This is the load-bearing mechanism, not backstop.

**C (keep-recent window):** PROMOTED to primary. Keep recent portion verbatim during compress (memsearch's `max_files=12` pattern, adapted to single `now.md`).

**B (mid-session size-triggered compaction):** DROPPED. Mature systems (memsearch) stay spiral-proof without it — window + cap at compress-time is sufficient. Removes a moving part (size checks in hot append path, new mid-session trigger).

**D (shrink-retry on timeout):** DEMOTED to defense-in-depth, possibly deferrable. With A capping input, should rarely fire.

**Rationale:** memsearch is the most analogous system (Claude Code memory plugin, Haiku-compressing server); it does A+C only, cleanly. Simpler design, fewer moving parts, grounded in one verified source.

**Why:** 19-system union was overengineered; anchoring on the two most-similar systems (memsearch + Letta) reveals the core is just input-cap + recent-window, not four mechanisms.

**How to apply:** Rewrite §8.2.5 + D-173 to reflect A+C as primary load-bearing, B dropped, D optional. Resolve overflow-handling rule (see next fact) before committing.
