The project uses numbered decision-log entries (e.g., D-262) to record decisions about known issues, regressions, and shipping decisions. When a limitation cannot be fixed in-version, the team documents it in the decision log with root-cause analysis and honest disclosure in release notes, rather than leaving it untracked or delaying release.

**Why:** Explicit decision logging ensures regressions are understood, non-obvious constraints are recorded for future maintainers, and stakeholders are informed about known limitations upfront.

**How to apply:** When a known issue persists (e.g., confirmed by restart/reload test), create a decision-log entry with root cause, refine it as new test data arrives, and reference it in release notes before shipping.
