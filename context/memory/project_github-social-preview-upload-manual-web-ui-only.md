GitHub does NOT expose social preview upload via REST API or `gh` CLI — upload is manual web UI only. Path: Settings → General/Options → "Social preview" → Edit → Upload image → select `docs/public/assets/og-image.png`. This is a deliberate GitHub limitation (internal endpoint, not public API).

**Why:** Explains why this step cannot be automated in release workflows and must remain a manual gate step.

**How to apply:** Document as a manual checkpoint in release runbook. Include the web-UI path. Cannot be scripted or CI'd.
