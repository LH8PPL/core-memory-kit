Calling `claude --print` from within an active Claude Code session can hang/timeout at 50s. This affected D6 (SessionStart self-heal compression) in this test run but is environmental to the nested harness, not a kit logic defect. Non-nested invocations work fine.

**Why:** D6 gate failed with `haiku_timeout`, but the failure pattern (timing out when called from inside Claude Code) repeats across multiple test attempts. Points to harness artifact, not kit bug.

**How to apply:** Validate D6 cleanly by running compress spawns outside an active Claude Code session. In real user SessionStart (not nested), the `claude --print` call will have a clean environment. Accept nested-harness timeouts as environmental noise.
