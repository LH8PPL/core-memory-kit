**The problem:** npm 12 (July 2026) turns install scripts off by default. better-sqlite3 uses binding.gyp → install script → silent failure → cmk crashes on first use.

**The 141a mitigation (shipped):** Install-time guard detecting broken binding, prompts user to fix.

**The 141b cure (slotted):** Migrate to node:sqlite (Node 22.5+, built-in, no native deps).

**Blockers for 141b:**
- API migration needed (all callers: index-db, search, semantic-backend, reindex)
- sqlite-vec extension cross-platform spike required
- Node floor bump to 22.5+ (user approved 2026-06-12)
- Verify node:sqlite is stable (not --experimental)

**Why:** npm-12 is a hard blocker for better-sqlite3. 141b removes the problem entirely; no native deps = install anywhere, forever.

**How to apply:** Spike sqlite-vec first; migrate APIs; bump Node floor and test cross-platform.
