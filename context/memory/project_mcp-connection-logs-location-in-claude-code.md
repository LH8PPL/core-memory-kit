- Path: `AppData/Local/claude-cli-nodejs/Cache/c--Temp-cut-gate21/mcp-logs-cmk/`
- Shows per-session: connection time, transport type, tools advertised, version
- Format example: "Successfully connected (transport: stdio) in 925ms ... hasTools:true"

**Why:** Needed to distinguish MCP server health from API-layer ToolSearch failures; logs are authoritative ground truth

**How to apply:** For future Claude Code/MCP integration issues, consult these logs to verify server connection success before treating it as an API bug
