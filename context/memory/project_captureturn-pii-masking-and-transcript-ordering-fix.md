`captureTurn` updated to prefer `payload.user_message` from Kiro Stop hook, apply identical PII masking as assistant turn, and write transcripts in user→assistant order.

Issues identified and resolved:
- PII-masking asymmetry (from self-review)
- B1 (transcript data-loss, from code-review)

Test result: 2829/2829 passing; PR staged.

**Why:** Ensures transcript correctness and consistent PII masking in the stop-hook capture system.

**How to apply:** Reference when modifying capture logic, transcript handling, or PII masking in the hook system.
