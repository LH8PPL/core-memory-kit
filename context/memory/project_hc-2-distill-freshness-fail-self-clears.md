Health check HC-2 (distill freshness) sometimes fails due to live-Haiku API jitter. This is a known transient that self-clears on retry. Not a blocker for gating.

**Why:** The check measures API response time; network fluctuations cause false negatives without indicating a real problem.

**How to apply:** If HC-2 fails during a gate health check, retry. If it passes on retry, proceed normally.
