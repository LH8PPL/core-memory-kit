The kit's privacy masking system masks the word "runner" (GitHub Actions' default username on ubuntu-latest). This causes FTS test failures on Linux only when fixtures reference "runner", because fixture content is masked but the test query is not. Workaround: reword test fixtures to avoid the word "runner". Issue documented in test class.

**Why:** Non-obvious behavior during CI testing; privacy mask works as designed but collides with GitHub Actions' own username convention. Future test debugging on Linux Actions may encounter this.

**How to apply:** When debugging FTS test failures on Linux Actions only, check if fixture content is being masked by the privacy system; if so, rename or reword to avoid masked terms.
