SonarCloud requires 80% new-code coverage for merge approval on this project. This gate is blocking merges until coverage meets the threshold.

**Why:** Hard constraint on the release process; future PRs will fail without adequate coverage.

**How to apply:** When modifying code paths (especially in install/uninstall tools), ensure all branches have test coverage to reach 80% threshold.
