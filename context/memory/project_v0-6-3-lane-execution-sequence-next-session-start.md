- **First**: PR 233 (recall hint + fire telemetry)
- **Note**: PR 248 (install-flow auto-recover) requires a fresh session because it touches the install path
- **Then**: PR 250 and riders (247/249) as grill-gated

**Why:** 233 is foundational; 248 needs clean state to avoid interaction with prior work; sequence ensures install-flow safety

**How to apply:** When next session begins v0.6.3 lane work, start with 233, flag 248 for fresh-session treatment
