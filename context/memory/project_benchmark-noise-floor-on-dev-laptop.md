The benchmark harness works correctly, but the dev laptop cannot reliably measure the perf gate (D-147):

- **Operations are sub-millisecond:** FTS5 ~0.1ms, vec ~1.5ms, inc ~0.5ms.
- **Measurement noise dominates:** better-sqlite3 measured against itself 10 times shows 2.2× variance on FTS5/vec, 2.0× on inc.
- **Root cause:** Windows timer granularity + background jitter (Claude Code, OS, CPU throttling).
- **The gate cannot be verified:** 3% tolerance (D-147 ratio ≤1.03) is orders of magnitude smaller than the ±100% noise.

**To get a clean number:** either (a) improve harness with heavier corpus (50k rows, batch queries into ~50ms units) so noise becomes a small fraction, or (b) defer to CI with a quieter runner + heavier corpus.

**Why:** Migration 141b depends on verifying D-147. The user will not push an unverified gate; data quality is the blocker.

**How to apply:** Next session should know this blocks 141b. If revisiting perf, start with the heavier-corpus harness option or a CI job.
