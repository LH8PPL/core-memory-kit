**Shows:** package count (added/changed), install completion status, activation reminder, config guidance (native memory behavior, semantic recall enablement)

**Omits:** npm deprecation warnings, MCP server PID list, npm funding notices

**Why:** Users need to know installation succeeded and how to activate it. Pre-emptive advisory noise doesn't help; real recovery messages surface at error time when needed.

**How to apply:** Enforce this design in install command; if verbose output reappears, treat as regression.
