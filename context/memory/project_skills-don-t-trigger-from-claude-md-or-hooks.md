Skills are NOT invoked by CLAUDE.md references or hook `additionalContext` injections. The actual mechanism:

- **CLAUDE.md:** Can name a skill for semantic reinforcement, but it's a soft suggestion (text the model reads), not a control.
- **Hooks:** Can inject `additionalContext` to nudge ("consider this skill"), but cannot invoke. Model decides.
- **Real trigger:** Skill's own `description` field + auto-discovery from `~/.claude/skills/`.

**Why:** It's non-obvious. Most would expect CLAUDE.md or hooks to be the invocation mechanism. Understanding the real mechanism prevents wasted attempts and false assumptions.

**How to apply:** Don't try to invoke skills via CLAUDE.md or hook text. Diagnose failures: (1) Is it installed to `~/.claude/skills/`? (2) Does its description match the context? Trust auto-discovery and description.
