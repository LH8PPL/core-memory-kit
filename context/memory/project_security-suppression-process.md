Sonar suppressions must be backed by a formal decision-log entry (D-### number) with per-class threat analysis. Real findings are fixed in code; false positives are suppressed. Pre-approved scopes (e.g., `packages/cli/src/**`) acceptable only if threat class has been reviewed AND structural safeguards (like `validate-spawn-discipline`) exist to catch violations.

**Why:** Prevents silent suppressions from hiding new issues; keeps decisions auditable and traceable.

**How to apply:** On Sonar CI failure, check if threat class was previously reviewed (search D-###). Apply prior decision or write new per-class review. Link D-# in PR or config. Rely on structural tools to catch future violations.
