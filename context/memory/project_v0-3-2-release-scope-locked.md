- **Version:** 0.3.1 → 0.3.2
- **Merged + shipped:** Tasks 153 (FTS5 query sanitization / mk_search crash), 152 (validate-index-completeness), 147 (cmk digest + append-only DECISIONS.md), js-yaml security fix, README rewrite, CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Rejected:** 141b (perf regression)
- **Status:** Ready to cut; CHANGELOG [Unreleased] entries prepared

**Why:** All planned tasks completed; 141b rejected on clean data. Release is unblocked pending manual tag push.

**How to apply:** Next: user runs `npm run release -- patch` (review diff) → pushes v0.3.2 tag → publishes. No code changes needed.
