`npm deprecate` reports authentication failures (missing/invalid `~/.npmrc` token or not logged in) as E404 ("Not Found") instead of E401 ("Unauthorized").

npm prints local `npm notice deprecating...` lines, then the registry PUT fails on auth, yielding a confusing E404.

**Fix:** Run `npm login` or ensure `~/.npmrc` has valid `//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=...`.

**Why:** Occurred during package rename; knowing the real cause (auth, not existence) saves debugging cycles.

**How to apply:** If `npm deprecate` fails with E404, check npm auth first.
