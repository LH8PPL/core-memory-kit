When compression fails, the kit's logger discards subprocess stderr and exit code. The compressor captures these details (compressor.mjs:285-296) at runtime but compress.log stores only error_category (e.g., "compress_failed"), not the actual reason.
- Failure modes can't be diagnosed (transient vs. deterministic unknown)
- Blocks retry logic design (can't know what we're retrying or why)
- Prior failures lost to investigation (forced guessing instead of data)

**Why:** Without stderr/exit-code in the log, the kit can't diagnose actual failure reasons. This prevents knowing whether failures are transient (worth retrying) or deterministic (unfixable by retry).

**How to apply:** Capture stderr and exit-code into compress.log as a prerequisite before designing retry behavior.
