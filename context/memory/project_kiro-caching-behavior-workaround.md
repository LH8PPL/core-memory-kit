Kiro IDE may cache hook commands. If a hook change doesn't take effect after rebuild:
- Global CLI rebuild alone usually suffices (hooks shell out to `cmk` fresh each time)
- If still not working, restart Kiro IDE to force hooks to reload

When hooks don't seem to be executing, restart before investigating deeper.

**Why:** Kiro spawns hook subprocesses, so it caches the *hook definition*, not always the CLI binary. Restart flushes Kiro's internal state.

**How to apply:** If a rebuilt CLI change isn't visible in Kiro hooks, try Kiro restart before troubleshooting further
