**Agent location:** `~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json` (not `~/.aws`; this is the D-198 bug now caught by gate check KCG2).

**CLI validation checks (KCG3/KCG4):**
- `kiro-cli agent validate` passes
- `agent list` shows `* cmk Global` (active agent)

**Debugging techniques baked into the gate:**
- **Fire-vs-not probe:** Point a hook at a stdin-logging script to capture whether agent fire events occur; crucial for diagnosing "agent does nothing" issues.
- **BOM trap:** PowerShell `ConvertTo-Json` corrupts agent config JSON; use Node.js instead.
- **"Nothing fires" diagnostic:** Check `agent list` output; if `kiro_default` appears active, the agent is in the wrong location.

**Version gating (Task 166):** V2 fires kiro-cli agents; V3 falls back to Kiro's native prompt.

**Why:** Each check/technique corresponds to a real bug discovered this session (D-198, BOM corruption, location misdiagnosis). Baking them into the gate prevents re-discovery in future debugging.

**How to apply:** Reference gate § KCG2-4 when diagnosing kiro-cli agent issues. Use the BOM workaround when editing agent config in PowerShell.
