- No documentation of update process in README/QUICKSTART
- No `cmk update` command wrapping the two-step workflow
- `cmk doctor` has zero version-drift detection (doesn't warn if global is older than project block, or if newer version on npm exists)
- Windows EBUSY gotcha undocumented

**Why:** Basic product expectation ("how do I update?") has no answer; v0.3.3 ready to ship but these are gaps for v0.3.4

**How to apply:** File as task for v0.3.4; minimum is README documentation + `cmk doctor` line; better is full `cmk update` command + drift checks
