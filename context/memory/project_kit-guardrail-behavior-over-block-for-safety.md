Guardrail can't distinguish command from documentation, so writing up an incident (describing a blocked command) triggers the block again. Both incidents treated as STOP, content rewritten rather than routed around.

**Why:** Kit's stated "over-block is safe" posture is intentional design, not defect; safe to trust and respect

**How to apply:** When blocked, investigate the trigger and rewrite; never bypass or try to confuse the guard
