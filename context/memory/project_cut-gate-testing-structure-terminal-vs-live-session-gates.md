Cut-guide.md has 10 sections (0–9). **Sections 0–1** are terminal-runnable (install + scaffold): gates G0, G1, G2, G2b, G3, G4, G6, G7. **Sections 2–9** require live Claude Code sessions: DJ gates (digest/journal), F gates (tombstone-recovery), M gates (MCP conversational), W gates (recall ladder).

**Why:** Determines what can run in CI/headless vs what needs user interaction; gate placement guides future test additions

**How to apply:** When adding new gates, place terminal-only checks in §0–1 and interactive/session-dependent gates in §2–9. Do not mix.
