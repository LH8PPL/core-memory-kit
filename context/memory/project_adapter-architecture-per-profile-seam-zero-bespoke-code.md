New adapters (e.g., Cursor) ride the generic per-profile seam with zero adapter-specific code in core.

Pattern: adapters provide profile hooks; core routes through a single unified seam. No special cases in main logic.

**Why:** Reduces maintenance burden and bug surface; each adapter is isolated. Cursor shipped zero-defect via this pattern (PR #254).

**How to apply:** When adding a new agent, define its profile hooks and wire them at the seam; core routing is already generic.
