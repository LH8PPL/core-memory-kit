- Develop and test fix on branch (PR #246)
- Submit PR; wait for CI to pass
- Merge to main (via `gh pr merge --squash --delete-branch`)
- Watch CI green on main branch
- Rebuild tarball from main
- Run cold-open test (fresh install in new dir, run test prompt in fresh Claude Code session)
- Only after cold-open succeeds: tag the release

**Why:** Ensures the fix is proven on the actual production commit (main) before publishing, not just in a dev branch.

**How to apply:** Before tagging any release, execute the cold-open workflow. Do not skip to tagging based on PR CI alone.
