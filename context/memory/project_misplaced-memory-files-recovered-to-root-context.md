Six memory files incorrectly written to nested package directories (packages/cli/context/ and packages/cli/src/context/) were recovered via faithful file relocation, preserving original metadata (created_at dates, ids). Recovery committed as d62b18e. Both source directories (gitignored/untracked) subsequently deleted.

**Why:** Task 246 recovery — ensuring memories written through capture-hooks end up in context/memory/ (root) rather than package-nested locations.

**How to apply:** If similar misdirection issues arise, faithful relocation preserves historical accuracy. Cleanup of empty directories is safe and produces no git changes since they were untracked.
