Always fix markdown lint warnings (MD022 blanks-around-headings, MD047 trailing-newline, etc.) when touching a file — do not leave them for later.

**Why:** The user's standing directive 2026-06-25. The kit commits memory into the user's repo; a user whose CI lints markdown gets warnings, so every file the agent writes/edits must be lint-clean by construction.

**How to apply:** When editing or writing any .md (including context/ memory files, docs, READMEs), ensure: blank line above AND below every heading (MD022), single trailing newline (MD047), blanks around lists/code-fences. If the IDE surfaces an MD diagnostic after an edit, fix it in the same turn — never defer.
