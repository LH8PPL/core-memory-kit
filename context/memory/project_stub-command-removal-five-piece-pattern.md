Task 131 deletes the `cmk view` stub command. Complete removal requires five file edits:
  - Remove the command implementation
  - Remove parity-guard entry
  - Remove CLI.md section
  - Remove validator allowlist entry
  - Remove cut-gate line
  - Auto-generated contract test is deleted along with the stub (1718 tests remaining)

**Why:** Stub deletions touch multiple locations across the codebase; recording the pattern prevents incomplete removals.

**How to apply:** When removing a future command stub, verify all five locations are cleaned and rerun the test suite to confirm contract tests were pruned.
