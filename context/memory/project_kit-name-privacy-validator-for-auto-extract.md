The kit's auto-extract mechanism includes a validator that blocks commits when a captured fact's text includes the user's wiki name or other sensitive project identifiers. When triggered, the fact can be safely purged and re-remembered in a name-clean form, allowing the commit to proceed.

**Why:** Kit memory is committed to git (possibly public). Personal/project names should not leak into public memory without user consent. This validator enforces privacy by design.

**How to apply:** If auto-extract blocks a commit due to name detection, use the kit's safe purge path to delete the offending fact and re-remember it with sensitive identifiers removed.
