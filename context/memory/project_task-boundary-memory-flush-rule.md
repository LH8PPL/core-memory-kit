This project applies a "task-boundary flush rule" — dogfood memory accumulated in `context/MEMORY.md`, `INDEX.md`, and `queues/review.md` during long sessions should be committed at natural stopping points (task boundaries), keeping git state synchronized with in-repo memory.

**Why:** Without periodic flushing, memory drifts from git, breaking continuity for future sessions. This project self-dogfoods its own memory system.

**How to apply:** At task boundaries, screen for uncommitted memory in those three files and commit per this rule, or defer the decision to the next session.
