- **Regex patterns** (~2ms, Presidio-style): Pattern-only, high precision for emails/phones/paths/keys; cannot handle context-dependent PII (names, health).
- **Local NER models**: Domain-brittle; performance degrades on different text types.
- **LLM judgment** (Haiku, ~180-400ms): Only high-recall option for names/health in conversation; suitable for detached process.
- **Anthropic PII purifier prompt**: Official expert resource; handles obfuscation patterns; returns full redacted text.

**Why:** Informs the three-layer PII detection architecture for the pipeline.

**How to apply:** Use as foundation for L1/L2/L3 implementation; prioritize Anthropic's prompt for LLM redaction layer (L3).
