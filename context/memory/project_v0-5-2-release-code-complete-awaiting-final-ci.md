- Code-complete as of 2026-07-13
- All three PRs merged to main
- Awaiting final ci.yml run (SonarQube advisory + ubuntu/macos/windows test matrix)
- Once green, cutover via `npm run release -- patch`

**Why:** Tracks readiness for npm release cutover; final step is CI confirmation.

**How to apply:** Check ci.yml green, then run npm run release when ready to publish v0.5.2.
