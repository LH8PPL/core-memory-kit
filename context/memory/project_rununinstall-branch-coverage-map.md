The `runUninstall --ide` command has four distinct branches that must each have test coverage:
- default-claude
- unknown-ide
- kiro
- nothing-to-remove

**Why:** Missing branch coverage causes gate failure; all paths must be tested for SonarCloud to pass.

**How to apply:** When writing tests for runUninstall changes, explicitly cover each of these four branches.
