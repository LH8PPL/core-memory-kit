Complete fact extraction (19 facts + 4 promotions, zero drops) can still *feel* incomplete when cross-project traits are queued in the persona-review system awaiting promotion. With 6 traits parked, the visible persona appears thinner than the work warrants—creating a real product-feel gap ("there should be more") despite comprehensive capture. This is the D-154 queue-drain design working correctly, not a capture failure.

**Why:** User's instinct about incompleteness is valid as a UX signal, but correctly identified as a promotion/visibility issue rather than a missing-facts issue.

**How to apply:** When reviewing capture completeness, check both facts-in-system and facts-in-visible-persona. Queue delays are expected; thinness may reflect pending promotion, not extraction failure.
