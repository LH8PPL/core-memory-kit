During testing, two issues were identified and fixed in the PR being merged:
1. **Dedup bug**: observation_count values were suppressed on turns where facts were stated (B1/B2 evidence), preventing proper logging
2. **Memory-search skill issue**: showed a permission prompt on first recall when it should not have prompted
Validation approach after merge:
- **Session 1, mid-run**: check `context/sessions/*.extract.log` for `observation_count > 0` entries on turns where facts were stated without saying "remember"
- **Session 2, first recall question**: memory-search skill should invoke and answer with no permission prompt

**Why:** These were bugs causing test suite failures. The PR fixes both; Session 1 & 2 testing confirms the fixes work correctly.

**How to apply:** After merge, pull, rebuild, then run Session 1 and Session 2 with these specific validation points in mind.
