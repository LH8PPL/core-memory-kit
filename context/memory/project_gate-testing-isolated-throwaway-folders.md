Gate tests run in disposable folders (e.g., `C:\Temp\cut-gate22`), each initialized with `git init` + cmk installed locally. Dev repo is not used for gate testing itself; the refreshed global artifact is what gate folders consume.

**Why:** Isolates test environment from dev state (uncommitted changes, corpus size, prior installs); ensures reproducible results; avoids D-293 memory issues

**How to apply:** Fresh gate folder: `git init`, `cmk install --with-semantic`, run all gate prompts in that folder. Create a new gate folder per release cycle.
