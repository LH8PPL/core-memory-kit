When testing whether a kit's Skill() permission forms work in Claude Code: **(a) EMPTY state** — remove all Skill entries from settings.json, state preference, click allow, observe what CC writes (form, location, target file); **(b) KIT state** — restore kit's form, state preference, observe if prompt appears and what form is used. Comparing the two reveals whether kit's form works or needs adjustment.

**Why:** Kit behavior depends on what Claude Code actually writes, not docs. Sub-tests isolate tool initialization from kit correctness.

**How to apply:** In future tool integration work, use paired sub-tests to test configuration forms rather than testing them simultaneously.
