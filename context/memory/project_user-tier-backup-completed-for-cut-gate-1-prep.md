Backup of ~/.claude-memory-kit successfully created at `C:\cut-gate-backups\user-tier_2026-07-12_14-49-40\`. Live ~/.claude-memory-kit is now absent. Backup contents verified: HABITS.md, LESSONS.md, USER.md, .locks/, fragments/, memory/, queues/.

**Why:** Gate workflow phase §0b (artifact validation) is now complete. Backup is required because §1 (Session 1) intentionally starts from zero to test capture-from-zero behavior honestly — persona tier must not interfere with that test.

**How to apply:** Session 1 will start fresh. After gate testing completes, restore persona with: `Move-Item "C:\cut-gate-backups\user-tier_2026-07-12_14-49-40" $env:USERPROFILE\.claude-memory-kit`
