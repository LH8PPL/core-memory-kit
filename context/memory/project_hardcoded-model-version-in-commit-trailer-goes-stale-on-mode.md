The CLAUDE.md commit-trailer rule currently contains a hardcoded model identifier (`Co-Authored-By: Claude Fable 5`). When you switch between Claude models mid-session via `/model` commands, this trailer does not update and becomes inaccurate on commits created after the model change. This occurred on commits earlier in this session after switching to Opus.

**Why:** You work with multiple Claude models in a single session and switch between them. Static trailers mean commit metadata no longer reflects which model actually created the code.

**How to apply:** For the next session, decide whether to either (a) accept the trailer as a project-level marker ("Claude Code co-authored") rather than per-commit model truth, OR (b) update CLAUDE.md to use a model-neutral form (e.g., `Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>`) that won't become stale when models switch.
