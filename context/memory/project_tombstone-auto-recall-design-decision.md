Tombstones (soft-deleted records) are kept invisible to the auto-recall system. Recovery of tombstoned data is human-only, explicit opt-in.

**Why:** Respects user intent and data integrity—deleted records should not auto-surface in the AI system.

**How to apply:** When building features interacting with tombstones, assume auto-recall will never surface them. Recovery requires explicit user action.
