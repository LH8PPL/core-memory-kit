The local pre-commit name-privacy validator runs against the git index (tracked files), not the working directory. Files created but not yet staged with `git add` bypass the local check and fail only when pushed to CI.

**Why:** Avoids wasted CI cycles and confusing "passes locally, fails remotely" failures during context/docs commits.

**How to apply:** When committing context/ or docs changes, stage files with `git add` *before* running validation, not after — the validator must see the staged state to catch new files.
