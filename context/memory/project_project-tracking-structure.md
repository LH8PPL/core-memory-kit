The project uses:
- RELEASE-PLAN: release notes and version notes
- tasks.md: progress tracking (items marked with Task N, stamped when shipped)
- RESUME-HERE: session marker (flipped from current task to next task, e.g., "next = v0.4.0")
- Git history (commits include task IDs, e.g., `30c43fd`)

This allows session continuity: next session reads RESUME-HERE to know what's next.

**Why:** Explicit tracking + session markers let sessions resume without re-deriving state.

**How to apply:** When shipping a feature, update tasks.md, stamp as shipped, flip RESUME-HERE to next task. Next session picks up there.
