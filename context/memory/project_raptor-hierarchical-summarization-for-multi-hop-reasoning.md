- **Pattern:** Recursive clustering → summarize clusters → cluster the summaries → repeat, building a hierarchical tree of summaries from leaves (raw docs) to root (global summary).
- **Use case:** Bridges multi-hop reasoning without requiring explicit graph edges; works with unstructured text + hierarchical structure inference.
- Maps to Task 176 (graph-based retrieval); introduces a new technique complementing edge-derivation and dedup-ladder patterns.

**Why:** The "beyond vector search" ML Mastery article names the 5 next-gen RAG strategies; RAPTOR is the one genuinely new to our research (others — GraphRAG, ColBERT, HyDE, Agentic RAG — already appear in our task list).

**How to apply:** Task 176: Add one-line note on RAPTOR as a hierarchical-summary alternative to explicit graph structures; consider as a read-list addition alongside Cognee deep-dive.
