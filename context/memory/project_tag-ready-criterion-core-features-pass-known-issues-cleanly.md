A version is tag-ready when all features it ships pass end-to-end, even if known issues exist in experimental features or pre-scoped future work. Example: v0.3.3 is tag-ready despite Task 161 (haiku_timeout in F-4 daily-distill and compression family) because that issue is cleanly filed and scoped to v0.3.4, not blocking v0.3.3's shipped features.

**Why:** Allows shipping working features while deferring known architectural issues to future releases without false urgency or version coupling.

**How to apply:** Before tagging, verify: (a) do the features in THIS release scope work end-to-end? (b) are known failures already filed and assigned to future work? (c) if both yes, tag. Use this model to unblock shipping.
