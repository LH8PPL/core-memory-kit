**Backup first**: User creates copy (e.g., `kiro-gate` → `failer3-kiro-gate`) before starting, as evidence and recovery point.

**§0b — Build artifact** (user-run):
- Execute: `npm pack` → uninstall global `cmk` → install the `.tgz` → verify `cmk --version`
- Expected output: version `0.4.0` (or current G0 value)
- Hand off: paste `cmk --version` output to assistant

**§1 — Fresh install verification** (next session):
- Create fresh env: `C:\Temp\kiro-gate` (mkdir + git init)
- Install: `cmk install --with-semantic --ide kiro` + run `cmk doctor`
- Run all checks KG1 → KG10 (all 5 Kiro surfaces, all 3 memory tiers)
- **Use global published `cmk` CLI, NOT local dev version**

**Notes**: §1 intentionally writes to `~/.aws` (backup protects against changes). The backup copy (`failer3-kiro-gate`) stays separate; untouched during §1.

**Why:** This is the canonical gate for verifying the published npm artifact works end-to-end in a real environment before release

**How to apply:** When testing a release, follow this sequence exactly; always backup before §0b; ensure §1 uses the global (published) CLI to test actual published behavior, never the local dev version
