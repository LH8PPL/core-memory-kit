Install Visual Studio Build Tools → close all terminals → open fresh terminal → run `cargo install <crate>`. Crate sources are pre-cached after first download attempt, so retries only compile+link (a few minutes), not full redownload.

**Why:** Understanding the build process and download cache behavior saves iteration time across install/reinstall cycles.

**How to apply:** Apply this workflow when installing Rust development tools with native compilation on Windows.
