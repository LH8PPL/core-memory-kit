The project's name-guard tool catches templated/placeholder patterns in frontmatter (e.g., `«name»wiki`), classified as D-310 errors, and blocks commits. Correct pattern: use descriptive language (e.g., "the user's personal-wiki") instead.

**Why:** Built-in guard against anti-patterns in metadata documentation; understanding this prevents merge-blocking surprises during commits.

**How to apply:** When writing metadata with user-level references, use full descriptive phrases rather than short templated patterns with placeholder markers.
