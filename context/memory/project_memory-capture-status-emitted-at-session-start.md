Memory capture failures (timeouts, missing previous session logs) are reported via automatic status line emitted in `inject-context.mjs:1097` via the `buildStatusLine()` function, which outputs to `systemMessage` (user-facing channel, not model-facing).

Output format: `⚠ memory captured N of M turns YYYY-MM-DD (reason if timeout/error)`

Behavior:
- Silent when healthy (no message)
- Reads previous session's log (current session has no data yet at SessionStart)
- Fails open if log is missing or malformed
- Shows success/timeout counts and window for diagnostics

**Why:** Provides automatic, non-disruptive visibility into a critical automatic subsystem without requiring user commands.

**How to apply:** When reporting health of automatic features, emit status to user-display channels (`systemMessage`) at natural breakpoints (session start, context injection). Keep messages terse when healthy, detailed when problems exist.
