The cursor-hook currently resolves the project root via `workspace_roots`. Research and Cursor staff guidance indicate that `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` (environment variable) is documented, always-present, and reliable across platforms. This sidesteps Windows path-format edge cases that can cause the `workspace_roots` normalization to fail.

Recommended fix: Prefer `process.env.CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` as the primary project root; fall back to `workspace_roots` (with normalize) only if the env var is absent.

**Why:** Previous debugging found Windows path normalization issues with `workspace_roots`; the env var is the documented, staff-recommended workaround for this platform-specific fragility.

**How to apply:** In cursor-hook code, check for `CURSOR_PROJECT_DIR` first before attempting `workspace_roots` path resolution.
