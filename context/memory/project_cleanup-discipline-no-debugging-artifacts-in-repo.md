Throwaway debugging scripts and temporary files (e.g., `sync-probe-tmp.mjs`, `warm.mjs`) must not be committed to the repo. When introduced during investigation or iteration, they must be deleted before final commit. The kit enforces this as "Phase-6 cleanup discipline."

**Why:** Keeps the repository clean and focused; prevents temporary exploration code from becoming committed artifacts.

**How to apply:** After investigation work, scan the repo for throwaway scripts and delete them before committing. Verify `git status` is clean.
