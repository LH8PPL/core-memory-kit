The CHANGELOG build script asserts when an anchor is not unique. When chaining multiple edits (e.g., CHANGELOG entry + task-checkbox flip), a failed assertion can be masked if the command sequence doesn't halt on first error; the commit proceeds with incomplete file updates.

**Why:** Silent script failures are easy to miss in automated workflows; this is a recurring gotcha.

**How to apply:** After chained automated edits, verify the commit's file count matches expectation by reading the actual commit file list. Never trust exit codes; inspect the actual diff to catch masked failures. Redo the commands with proper error handling (single invocations per logical step, or explicit error traps).
