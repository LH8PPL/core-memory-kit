**Finding**: Zero of 32 surveyed projects implement multi-CLI routing (automatic routing to whichever agent CLI is installed).

**Field's four patterns**:
- No headless LLM call (~19) — deterministic search; cross-agent via MCP
- Single specific CLI (~6) — locked to one agent (typically `claude -p`)
- Cloud API key (~4) — bypasses agent, calls direct API
- Agent SDK (~4) — one agent SDK headlessly

**Also confirmed**: Amazon Q/Kiro is single-CLI; shells out to `q` in delegate.rs.

**Why:** Validates that automatic + portable (work with any agent CLI) is a genuine market gap the field hasn't solved. The field chose one property; this project insists on both.

**How to apply:** When designing the multi-CLI feature, remember there's no established convention—prioritize correctness and clarity.
