The memory kit's hooks (Stop-hook, SessionStart-hook, etc.) fire against the currently open project directory in Claude Code. If the wrong project is open, hooks will write memory to the wrong project's `context/`.

**Why:** Hooks execute in the context of the Claude Code window that triggered them, which is tied to the open project directory. They read `.claude/settings.json` from the working directory.

**How to apply:** Ensure the correct project is open in Claude Code before starting a session. When running demos or multi-project work, verify the working directory matches the intended target.
