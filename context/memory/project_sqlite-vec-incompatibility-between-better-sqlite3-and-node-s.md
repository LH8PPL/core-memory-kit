better-sqlite3 and node:sqlite cannot both load the sqlite-vec extension in the same Node.js process — they crash. This forces benchmarking comparisons to run the two libraries in separate processes rather than in-process (alternating), which adds process-startup overhead and measurement noise.

**Why:** Explains why the 141b benchmark produced ±50% variance and why detecting the target 3% perf difference was impossible. Documents a hard constraint on how these libraries can be compared.

**How to apply:** When revisiting 141b or similar benchmarks, plan for separate-process methodology. Accept higher baseline noise. To get a clean number, run on a quiet machine or wire the harness into CI to minimize variance. If single-process benchmarking is needed, evaluate whether one library can run without sqlite-vec loaded.
