- SonarCloud Quality Gate pass/fail results post as GitHub check runs, not Actions workflow status
- The `gh run list` command shows the analysis job status (uploaded = success) but does not surface the gate result
- This caused a disconnect where the workflow appeared green while the gate actually failed
- **Process fix:** After pushing to main, enumerate the commit's check runs and filter to non-success status; empty output means all checks (including SonarCloud) passed
- Workflow status alone is insufficient for verifying CI green on a commit

**Why:** This session missed a SonarCloud Quality Gate failure while relying on workflow status alone

**How to apply:** When verifying main branch CI status, always enumerate check runs to filter non-success, not just checking workflow runs
