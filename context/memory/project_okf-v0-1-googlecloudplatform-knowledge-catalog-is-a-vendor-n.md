OKF v0.1 (GoogleCloudPlatform/knowledge-catalog) is a vendor-neutral spec: markdown files + YAML frontmatter (required 'type' field) + index.md + log.md + git-native + agent-maintainable. core-memory-kit's context/ tier is ~90% OKF-aligned, and the maintainer's personal wiki already matches OKF structure (wiki/index.md, wiki/log.md). The kit is ahead of OKF on the hard parts: trust levels, tiering, caps, capture coercion, poison screening, hybrid recall. Google independently converged on the same markdown-in-git agent-maintained shape — validating the pattern. See docs/research/2026-07-22-okf-google-open-knowledge-format.md, Task 251, D-391.

**Why:** Positions the kit within an emerging vendor-neutral ecosystem; strengthens the adoption narrative and external credibility

**How to apply:** OKF research note + SOURCES entry recorded; Task 251 (cmk export --okf interop) filed deferred with a named trigger
