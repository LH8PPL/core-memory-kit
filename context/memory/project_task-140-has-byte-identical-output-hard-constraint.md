Task 140 canonicalizes loop-based trailing-strip operations.
Output MUST be byte-identical (hard constraint).
This is critical because output feeds content-addressed ID generation downstream.

**Why:** Any byte difference breaks downstream content-addressed systems

**How to apply:** When implementing Task 140, use byte-exact verification; do not relax this constraint
