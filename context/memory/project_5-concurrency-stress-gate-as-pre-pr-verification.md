The project uses a 5× concurrency stress gate (re-running the full test suite 5 times concurrently) to surface concurrency-class bugs before PR. Exit code 0 means all 5 runs passed; this gate confirms safety for PR review.

**Why:** Concurrency bugs are hard to trigger in single runs; stress gates reliably expose them.

**How to apply:** After fixing flakes, re-run the stress gate. Only open PR once gate is clean (5/5 passed).
