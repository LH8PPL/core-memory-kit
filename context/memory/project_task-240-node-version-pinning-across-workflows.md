- **Problem:** `node-version` literal copy-pasted in 11 blocks across 8 workflows; divergence already present (bench-storage ran Node 24, gates ran Node 20)
- **Solution:** Centralize to single `.nvmrc`; all workflow blocks read from it
- **Validator:** `validate-node-pin.mjs` fails build on bare literals; empty allowlist by design to force documented divergence
- **Proof:** Planted test value (`node-version: 18`), verified exact failure message and remedy, reverted clean
- **Design choice:** bench-storage joins the pin rather than staying as documented divergence (rationale: benchmark with different major version than gates is a silent confound on benchmark validity)

**Why:** Silently divergent runtimes between benchmark and gates hide configuration drift and undermine benchmark numbers. Structural validation prevents future regression.

**How to apply:** Use this architecture pattern when similar multi-block config-consistency issues arise; the empty-allowlist validation pattern is reusable elsewhere.
