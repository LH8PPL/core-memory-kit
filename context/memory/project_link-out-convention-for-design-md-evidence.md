claude-memory-kit applies a "link-out, don't inline" policy:
- Deep evidence (benchmarks, research, cross-system studies) links to docs/research/ instead of inlining
- Architectural decisions link to docs/adr/, not inlined into design.md
- design.md is the canonical Spine; large evidence blocks belong elsewhere to prevent bloat
- Status: applied this session but not yet formalized as a binding rule (only exists in decision log D-228)

**Why:** Prevents recurring mistakes of inlining large evidence blocks into the Spine, which bloats the critical design.md file. Future sessions need explicit guidance.

**How to apply:** Formalize as a binding rule in DOCUMENTATION-MAP's doc-routing section (with pointer from CLAUDE.md's source-of-truth area) so all future sessions follow the convention
