CLI cut-gate re-run after merge includes at least two components: (1) standard CLI tests, (2) paraphrase-recall check. The paraphrase-recall check catches failures that keyword-mode validation may miss.

**Why:** Ensures comprehensive semantic validation of the merged build before considering work complete.

**How to apply:** When re-running cut-gate post-merge, expect both standard and paraphrase-based semantic checks.
