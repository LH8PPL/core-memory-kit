- The og-image.svg (.png export) is fully vector-based (`<path>` elements); contains no editable text layer
- No Figma file, design template, or generation script exists in the repository
- Updating text requires regenerating from original design source; direct SVG path editing is fragile and error-prone
- Image is uploaded manually to GitHub's social-preview via the web UI (not auto-generated or deployed)

**Why:** Future brand updates need to know that text changes cannot be done via SVG editing; regeneration from source is the proper workflow

**How to apply:** When updating og-image content, regenerate from the original design file; do not attempt direct SVG path edits
