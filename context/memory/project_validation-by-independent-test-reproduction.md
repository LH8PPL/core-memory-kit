Fixes are validated by independently re-running the test suite and observing actual behavior (exit codes, runtime state transitions) rather than code reading alone. Example: migration/sentinel composition validity confirmed by running it, not reading the code.

**Why:** Reproduction catches real-world behavior that test fixtures or code review misses.

**How to apply:** When arbitrating correctness disputes, prefer running the suite independently over static analysis; this method proved reliable for Task 256.
