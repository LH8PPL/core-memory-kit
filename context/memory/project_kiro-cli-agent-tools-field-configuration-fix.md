The kiro-cli agent lacked a `tools` field in its configuration, preventing the model from invoking shell commands. Adding `tools: ['*']` enabled all tool execution.

Root cause of misdiagnosed issues #5873, #5376, #7431, #4579 — these were NOT kiro framework bugs, but missing agent configuration.

Validated live in commit a60b11a.

**Why:** Agents without `tools` cannot execute tools; they can only return text and may fake success responses.

**How to apply:** When setting up new agents, include `tools: ['*']` (or specific tool list) in agent config. When debugging tool invocation failures, check this field first.
