All 4 cut-gate guides (base, cursor, kiro, kiro-cli) updated for v0.5.4 rename:
- Config path: ~/.claude-memory-kit → ~/.core-memory-kit
- npm package: @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit → @lh8ppl/core-memory-kit
- CLAUDE.md marker: claude-memory-kit:start → core-memory-kit:start
- v0.5.4 banner added (uninstall-old-first flow); checkout path C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit preserved

**Why:** Guides are user-facing verification steps and must reflect new naming for v0.5.4; uninstall-old-first is cut-specific

**How to apply:** Reference guides during v0.5.4 cut testing; verify users follow uninstall-old-first during installation
