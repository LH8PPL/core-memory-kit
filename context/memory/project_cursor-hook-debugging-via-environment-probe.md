When debugging Cursor integration issues (e.g., hook invocation, environment inheritance), write a probe that logs:
- `process.cwd()` — working directory at hook invocation
- All `CMK_*` and `MEMORY_KIT_*` environment variables
- Relevant state files (e.g., gate-now.md, hook output)

Deploy the probe as the cursor-hook code, run one test turn in Cursor, then inspect the env dump to verify assumptions about environment inheritance.

**Why:** Cursor's hook spawning behavior and environment inheritance is opaque; these cannot be reliably inferred from code inspection. The logged env dump is definitive ground truth.

**How to apply:** When debugging cursor integration, prefer probe-based investigation (hypothesis → write probe → test in Cursor → inspect env dump) over code inspection alone.
