Recovery operations (e.g., reading tombstones) degrade gracefully on malformed entries rather than crash: missing/garbled frontmatter → return raw body + null provenance + `tombstoned: true`. Recovery path never throws; worst case is partial metadata loss. Worth explicit test case: malformed tombstone file (no/garbled frontmatter) → `tombstoned: true`, body present, provenance nulls.

**Why:** Recovery happens *because* something went wrong; crashing would prevent recovery. A graceful-degrade contract should be locked by test.

**How to apply:** For recovery/read paths encountering malformed data, return best-effort recovery (body + nulled metadata) rather than error; test the malformed-entry path explicitly.
