SonarCloud's "Agent-Centric Development" beta feature is the root cause of the opendir crash.
- Beta rolled out 2026-07-11, exact timing match to crash start
- Feature is toggleable: SonarCloud → Organization Admin → Agent-Centric Development
- Workaround: disable beta in org settings, rerun scan
- Secondary check: clear stale paths in project settings containing `C:/proj`

**Why:** Root cause identified and empirically verified; Beta rollout date correlates perfectly with crash onset; reproduced across SonarJS versions

**How to apply:** If SonarCloud scans crash next session, first step is disabling Agent-Centric Development beta in org settings; escalate with this evidence trail if workaround fails
