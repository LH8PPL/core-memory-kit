When a task involves only file-mutation + in-process doctor checks with no spawn/hook/concurrency surface, stress tests are intentionally skipped. Documented precedent established in Task-214 and Task-220.

**Why:** These operations have no async/timing surface where race conditions could hide; stress testing is not informative.

**How to apply:** When reviewing completed tasks, a skipped-stress-test note with this rationale indicates deliberate choice, not oversight. Consider it acceptable for Task-230 and similar future tasks.
