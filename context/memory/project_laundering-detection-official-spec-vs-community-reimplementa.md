Detect when community reimplementations (e.g., GitHub `dream-skill`, whose README states "replicates unreleased feature") are presented as official Anthropic/OpenAI specs.

**Example:** "100 sessions / 200-line index / four named phases" originates from dream-skill, not Anthropic official docs (which omit these details).

**Implication:** Only official documented sources count as design requirements; unofficial reimplementations are guesses, not binding prior art.

**Why:** Prevents building design decisions on false assumptions sourced from hobbyist guesses instead of actual official contracts.

**How to apply:** When cross-referencing design elements, always verify in official primary docs first; flag any claim absent from official sources as "unofficial guess, not binding spec".
