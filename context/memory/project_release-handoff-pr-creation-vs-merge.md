The project's release protocol: assistant creates the PR, user performs merge + tag + push. Assistant asks for approval before creating the PR.

**Why:** User retains final control over what ships to production.

**How to apply:** When a task is ready to ship, assistant creates the PR; user does the merge/tag/push ("outward steps").
