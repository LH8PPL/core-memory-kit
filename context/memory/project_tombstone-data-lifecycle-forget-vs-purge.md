- `forget` writes the fact to `archive/tombstones/<id>.md` (preserving body, `deleted_at`, `reason`, `deleted_by`)
- Simultaneously prunes the database row
- Result: fact is preserved on disk but no command surfaces it (get returns "not found", search excludes by default)
- `purge --hard` is the true deletion path (removes both DB row and tombstone file)
- This design is intentional: distinguish "forget = reversible" (data kept) from "purge = destructive" (data gone)

**Why:** Product decision pending on recovery surfaces. Current architecture is the constraint: data exists (kept by design), so recovery would be a read operation, not a reconstruct. This context informs scope and feasibility.

**How to apply:** When evaluating recovery features (e.g., `cmk restore` or `get --include-tombstoned`), remember the design intent: forget was always meant to be reversible. Recovery is technically possible (data is there), just not currently wired.
