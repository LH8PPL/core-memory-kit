Two parallel update workflows with identical structure:
- **npm path (Path A):** `npm install -g @latest` → `cmk install` per project → `cmk doctor` verify
- **plugin path (Path B):** `/plugin marketplace update` → `/plugin update` → `/reload-plugins` → `/claude-memory-kit:bootstrap` per project

Both paths require re-scaffolding each affected project (non-obvious pain point).

**Why:** This decision point (which path to document/support) requires honest accounting of both user experiences. Both paths share the same fundamental workflow; both have identical "forgotten per-project step" failure mode.

**How to apply:** Use this when choosing documentation scope. Remember: npm path could collapse to `cmk update` wrapper (with EBUSY guidance baked in); plugin path is constrained by Claude Code's own command set.
