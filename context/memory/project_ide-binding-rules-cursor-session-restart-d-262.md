**Cursor (VS Code fork):** Hooks load at session start, so "fully quit + reopen Cursor after install, before any live check" is a ★★ binding rule
- A pre-install session falsely reads as "hook didn't fire" even if it was installed
- v0.4.4 gate hit this trap; now a standing requirement for Cursor testing

**Why:** Cursor inherits VS Code's session lifecycle; older sessions won't load post-install hooks

**How to apply:** Document this in platform-specific gates in bold; enforce full IDE quit+reopen before running live checks
