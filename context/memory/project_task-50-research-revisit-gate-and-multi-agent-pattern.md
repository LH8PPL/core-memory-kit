**Task 50 workflow:**
- Begins with clone-and-read of multi-agent projects: claude-mem, Taskmaster, OpenHands, competitor specs
- Taskmaster review already complete; provides `createProfile()` blueprint + Kiro paths for verification
- Adopt convergent pattern: base-factory + thin-per-agent + transform + lifecycle-hook (don't re-derive)
- Verify each agent against its primary docs, not the convergence alone

**Why:** Leverage existing multi-agent research; avoid re-derivation. Taskmaster provides actionable blueprints before Task 50 starts.

**How to apply:** When Task 50 begins, start with research-revisit gate. Use Taskmaster as reference implementation. Apply adopted pattern to all v0.4.1+ agent integrations.
