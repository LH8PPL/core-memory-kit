When a CI gate fails, do not assume transience from one run. Re-running reveals root cause: different errors or endpoints indicate infrastructure issue (server-side flake, wedged state); identical errors across runs suggest code issue. Attempt 1 produced 504 at analysis creation; attempts 2–3 produced 500 at project endpoint — variation across runs is the diagnostic signal.

**Why:** Calling a failure "transient flake" after one attempt hides infrastructure problems. Comparing multiple runs transforms an assumption into a characterized failure.

**How to apply:** For CI failures, run 2+ times and compare error codes, endpoints, timing. Different errors = investigate server-side (check D-386, status pages, account state). Same error = likely code issue requiring fix.
