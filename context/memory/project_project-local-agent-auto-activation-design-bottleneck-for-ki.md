**Open Question:** Does project-local `.kiro/agents/cmk.json` auto-activate (hooks fire) when user runs `kiro-cli` with NO global `chat.defaultAgent`?

**Current State:**
- Agent FILES can be project-local in `.kiro/agents/` (documented; precedence over global)
- Activation currently requires global `chat.defaultAgent: cmk` (forced global)

**Impact:**
- If YES (auto-activates) → achieve Claude-Code parity: fully repo-portable, no ~/.kiro global footprint
- If NO → design constraint: activation stays global; agent file can still move local (smaller improvement)

**Test Approach:** 5-case empirical matrix with sentinel hooks in project-local agent config; headless `kiro-cli chat --no-interactive` runs with varying (global default, local agent, explicit flag) combos. **Case A (no global + local agent present + no flag) is linchpin:**—if hooks fire, auto-activation confirmed.

**Why:** Docs do not clarify auto-activation behavior for project-local agents. This gap blocks understanding whether Kiro can achieve full repo portability and parity with Claude Code. User is committing to empirical testing to resolve this design question.

**How to apply:** Run the 5-case test matrix. **Case A hooks fire** = auto-activation works = proceed to implementation task for project-local agent deployment. **Case A no hooks fire** = design constraint confirmed = document activation requirement; pursue smaller agent-file cleanup separately.
