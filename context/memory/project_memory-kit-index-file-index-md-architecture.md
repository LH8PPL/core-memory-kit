**What:** INDEX.md is the kit's unified metadata index. It contains pointers/listing for all memory facts in the project.

**Maintenance:** The kit automatically touches (writes to) INDEX.md on every fact save, keeping it current with the full fact set.

**Size:** Currently ~307 fact files per project. INDEX.md is the single metadata backbone.

**Usage:** Systems needing to detect "did anything new arrive?" can check INDEX.md's timestamp instead of stat-ing all 307 files. Saves ~130ms per full-directory scan.

**Why:** This is the kit's internal architecture. Understanding it is key to designing efficient session-start logic (e.g., Task 159's decision journal refresh).

**How to apply:** Trust that INDEX.md is always current — the kit maintains it. Use it for quick "anything changed?" queries. Do not try to manually update it; the kit is authoritative.
