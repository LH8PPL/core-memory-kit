Before testing DJ4-live (journal-scoped search), ensure:
- `cmk digest` has been run in the live project to generate `context/DECISIONS.md`
- Claude Code has been restarted after any MCP reinstall (old processes serve stale binary)
- Test against a superseded decision (e.g., "did we reject anything for the chat topology — what and why?") to exercise the journal scope

**Why:** Without DECISIONS.md, `mk_search {scope:"decisions"}` has nothing to return; restarting picks up the current build and avoids stale-process masking; testing against a retracted decision exercises the journal's unique value over fact-based recall

**How to apply:** Before DJ4-live re-test, run `cmk digest` in the project, kill stale MCP processes (or restart Claude Code), then ask Claude about a decision you know was rejected
