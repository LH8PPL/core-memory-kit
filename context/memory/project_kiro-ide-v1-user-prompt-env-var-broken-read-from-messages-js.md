- **Diagnosis confirmed:** Kiro IDE 1.0 platform bug—`UserPromptSubmit` hook unreliable, `USER_PROMPT` env var empty/malformed (GitHub issues #9619, #6188, #7375, #4620)
- **Current impact:** Kit's capture path relies on `USER_PROMPT` → auto-extract fails on Kiro IDE
- **Workaround available:** Kit already has `parseKiroIdeV1Messages()` to extract user turn from `messages.jsonl` transcript
- **Fix strategy:** Route user-turn capture through transcript instead of broken env var
- **Known caveat:** Timing unresolved—whether transcript is available when Stop hook fires

**Why:** Auto-extract is the kit's headline feature; broken on Kiro IDE 1.0. Diagnosis now sourced and confirmed. Workaround is feasible and under kit's control. Blocks shipping per D-292.

**How to apply:** Modify Kiro IDE capture path to use `parseKiroIdeV1Messages` to read user turn from `messages.jsonl`. Verify transcript is populated when Stop hook executes.
