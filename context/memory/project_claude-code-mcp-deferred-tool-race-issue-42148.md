- **Root cause:** Claude Code v2.1.x (#42148) freezes the deferred-tool list before MCP servers connect (10–30s), causing `mk_remember` to be unavailable on first ToolSearch
- **Mitigation:** The `memory-write` skill's CLI fallback is the intended recovery — it captures successfully when MCP is not yet ready
- **Scope:** This is Claude Code client-side behavior, not a kit bug; session-1 fallback is working as designed

**Why:** Explains Session-1 first-turn `mk_remember` miss; confirms fallback mitigation is working as intended, not a gate blocker

**How to apply:** Document in gate guide as "expected on fresh install; retry next turn or use CLI fallback." Do not treat as blocker. Gate M0 passes in warm session (proven—`mk_search` ran live).
