Branch `task-50-kiro-rework` has **completed**:
- ✅ 50.I — skills discovery/registration
- ✅ 50.J — dispatcher + adapter wiring
- ✅ 50.K — IDE hook writer (platform-correct Windows/POSIX)
- ✅ `cmk hook` verb (end-to-end) + readKiroTurn (transcript parsing)
- ✅ Full suite green (2113/0 tests)

**Remaining for PR-1:** orchestrator step — `cmk install --ide kiro` command wiring all 4 surfaces (skills, steering, MCP, IDE hooks) and replacing the incorrect #210 Kiro profile. Then live end-to-end test with real Kiro capture.

**Why:** Modular approach lets each surface be verified before final orchestration. Orchestrator is the glue layer that enables the full user workflow.

**How to apply:** Next session, build the orchestrator module and its tests. Use the AWS articles and existing memory (`P-CJYGTQYR` env+argv pattern) as reference. Then validate with a live turn capture on real Kiro setup.
