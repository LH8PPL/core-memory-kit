When `.claude/agents/` definitions are created or updated in a session, they are loaded at session start. However, the *same* session cannot invoke them by name — named references to agent definitions only work in *subsequent* sessions.

Workaround: In the session where agents are defined/updated, inline the agent rules explicitly (model pinning, role rules, instructions) rather than referencing by name. Subsequent sessions can use named invocation.

**Why:** Understanding agent-definition lifecycle is critical when orchestrating multi-agent workflows within a single session. This quirk would otherwise cause unexpected failures or require awkward manual workarounds.

**How to apply:** When spinning up a new multi-agent feature in one session, do not rely on named agent invocation; inlinethe agent configuration directly. In the next session, named invocation is available and works as expected.
