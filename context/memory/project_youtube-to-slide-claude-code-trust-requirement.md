Writing to memory curation tasks requires the Claude Code trust flag to be set for `C:\Projects\youtube-to-slide`.

Current status: NOT SET (blocking curation writes)

Unblock by one of:
- Open Claude Code in `C:\Projects\youtube-to-slide` and accept the trust dialog (automatic)
- Manually edit `~/.claude.json` and set `projects["C:/Projects/youtube-to-slide"].hasTrustDialogAccepted: true`

**Why:** The permission system enforces trust boundaries for sensitive operations like memory writes; the assistant cannot modify ~/.claude.json without explicit user action.

**How to apply:** Next session: if curation fails, check trust status immediately. Verify `projects["C:/Projects/youtube-to-slide"].hasTrustDialogAccepted` in ~/.claude.json.
