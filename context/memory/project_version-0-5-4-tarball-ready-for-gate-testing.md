Package version: **0.5.4** (current)
Tarball location: `packages/cli/lh8ppl-core-memory-kit-0.5.4.tgz`
Used for cut-gate test projects (e.g., `C:\Temp\cut-gate23`) before npm publish.

**Why:** Gate testing requires reproducible installation from the built tarball; avoids npm dependency before validation.

**How to apply:** Point test-project installs to this tarball. After all gate sections pass, publish to npm and tag the main branch.
