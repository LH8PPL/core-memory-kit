Python-based whole-file rewrites can normalize line endings (e.g., CRLF → LF or vice versa), breaking tools like vitest that depend on consistent file structure. The issue surfaced when rewriting a test file.

**Why:** Python's text I/O defaults may not preserve the original file's line-ending convention. In mixed-OS repos, this causes silent failures that are hard to debug.

**How to apply:** When rewriting test files or repo files from Python, explicitly preserve the original file's line-ending style. Open with newline='' and detect/restore the original convention.
