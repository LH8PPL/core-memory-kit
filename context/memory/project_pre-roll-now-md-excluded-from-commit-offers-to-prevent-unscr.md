The session-start commit offer explicitly excludes `context/now.md` (the pre-roll, unscreened daily file) from:
- The count of files in the offer
- The instruction text shown to the user

This prevents the user from accidentally shipping a raw (unscreened) name when accepting the offer. Separately, the privacy screen processes `now.md` in the background and drains it into the screened daily file, which is then included in the next commit offer.

**Why:** Guarantees personal names are privacy-screened before any commit ships; prevents accidental unscreened context leakage

**How to apply:** When working on commit-offer logic or privacy-screen workflows, remember this exclusion-during-processing pattern as a safety guard
