To isolate whether a regression is code/config vs environment:
1. Take the old version folder (unchanged code, identical config)
2. Test it in the new environment
3. If issue reproduces → cause is environmental (CC version, session state, hook load-timing)
4. If issue doesn't reproduce → cause is in new code/config version

Example: v0.4.3 folder (byte-identical `settings.json`) prompts in CC 2.1.198 → proves cause is CC, not v0.4.4 release.

**Why:** Rules out variables systematically. Avoids guessing or chasing red herrings.

**How to apply:** Before investigating code changes, test the old folder first in the new environment. Narrows the search to environmental or code/config differences.
