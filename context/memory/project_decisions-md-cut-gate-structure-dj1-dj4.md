DECISIONS.md testing is organized as four sequential cut-gate stages:
- **DJ1** (write): `cmk digest` renders and creates DECISIONS.md from `type:project` facts
- **DJ2** (write): append-only enforcement; forgotten decisions marked `_(retracted)_` (never deleted)
- **DJ3** (write): fact-type filter; only `type:project` journaled (feedback/reference excluded)
- **DJ4** (recall): full chain test — `remember → digest → search --scope decisions` returns found decision; after forget, still returns same decision marked `(retracted)`

DJ4 splits into two verification halves:
- **Mechanism (CLI)**: hard PASS criterion; fully testable via command execution in `cli-search.test.js`
- **Behavior (in-chat)**: whether Claude *chooses* `--scope decisions` when asked a history question; manual human-eyeball check only (automated tests cannot assert user-agent behavior)

**Why:** Ensures DECISIONS.md recall is reliable across the full lifecycle (create, digest, forget, recall-as-retracted). The mechanism/behavior split acknowledges what can vs cannot be auto-tested.

**How to apply:** When releasing DECISIONS.md features or running cut-gate, follow all four stages. DJ4's manual check is part of the human cut-gate checklist (not CI); automated unit tests verify the CLI mechanism.
