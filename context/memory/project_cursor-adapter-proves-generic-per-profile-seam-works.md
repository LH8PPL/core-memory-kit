PR #254 shipped Cursor as first-class agent with zero bespoke code. All lifecycle legs (inject/capture/observe/compress/guard) route through single `cmk cursor-hook` dispatcher via D-180 data-not-classes pattern. This is the first non-native agent to use the generic seam and proves it works end-to-end.

**Why:** Generic seam is the kit's core extensibility strategy. Real-world proof validates the design.

**How to apply:** For new agents, reference Cursor (PR #254) as the exemplar. Use the generic seam, do not write per-agent custom wiring.
