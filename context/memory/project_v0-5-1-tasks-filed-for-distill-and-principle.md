- Task 203: HC-10 must verify `recent.md` freshness; lazy fallback must stop shadowing daily distill; `register-crons` should set `WakeToRun=True`
- Task 204: Principle that long jobs must be incremental + resumable-from-artifacts (prevents repeat in next long job)
- Both filed in `tasks.md`, laned in `RELEASE-PLAN.md` under v0.5.1
- Recorded as D-298/D-299 on main, CI green
- Blocks: none (pre-existing defect, distill works on demand, `recent.md` fresh now)

**Why:** User's insight that "memory just works automatically" was broken by silent distill failure; the principle ensures future long jobs won't repeat it.

**How to apply:** Treat as the first committed work of v0.5.1; refer to D-298/D-299 in code/PRs; use Task 203 as reference implementation of the incremental+resumable pattern.
