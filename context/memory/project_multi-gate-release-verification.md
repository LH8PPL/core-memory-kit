Standing pattern: before tagging any release, run (1) CLI-deterministic gate (kiro-cli + cursor-agent backends on real tarball), (2) Claude live-session gate, (3) Cursor live-session gate (manual). All three must pass. Non-blocking issues lane to next version; blockers prevent tagging.

**Why:** Catches integration failures that unit tests miss. Multi-agent + MCP-backend setup requires live verification to ensure safety.

**How to apply:** Document gate results (per D-281, D-282 pattern). Use results to determine go/no-go for tagging.
