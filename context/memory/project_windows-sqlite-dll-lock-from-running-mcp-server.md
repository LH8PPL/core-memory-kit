On Windows, a running MCP server holds an EBUSY lock on sqlite.dll, preventing clean package reinstall of cmk.

Symptom: Cannot uninstall/reinstall cmk globally if an MCP-hosting Claude session is active in this directory or another.

Recovery: Close all MCP-hosting sessions → then clean reinstall cmk tarball → doctor.

**Why:** Blocks upgrade workflows silently. Surfaced when trying to verify v0.5.0; would have affected real users if code had shipped without catching this.

**How to apply:** When doing global cmk upgrades or clean installs, close MCP-hosting sessions first. Document this in upgrade/troubleshoot guides.
