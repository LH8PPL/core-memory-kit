Task 151.5 was re-designed from a simple intuitive approach (single-axis sweep order) to a research-backed approach (two-axis conjunction — low-trust-and-stale swept first, high-trust persona never swept) after research validated the documented bug pattern. The research-backed design is more correct.

**Why:** Grounding design decisions in research rather than intuition produces more robust, maintainable systems; research captures known best practices.

**How to apply:** When research documents a design choice or bug pattern, use it to guide implementation even if a simpler approach seems safer or more intuitive.
