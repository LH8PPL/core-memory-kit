CH2/W1 (inject/recall) must verify **actual memory content**, not just successful hook execution
- D-269: Kiro shipped broken (empty snapshots) for two minors; unit tests passed but output was invalid
- Live-check verification must confirm injected memory contains real data, not empty structures

**Why:** Hook execution != data integrity. Unit tests can validate hook firing but not output correctness

**How to apply:** In platform cut-gates, add explicit CH2/W1 verification: inject surfaces must return populated memory, not ""
