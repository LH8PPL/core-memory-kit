- **kiro-cli's approach:** extraction happens inline within the interactive turn, no separate backend
- **Kit's approach:** separate headless backend with LLM calls for compression/extraction (BK1–BK4)
- **Tradeoff:** inline extraction is simpler and zero-infra; separate backend enables async and cross-platform portability (Kiro, Cursor, without API keys)

**Why:** Another real-world solution to agent learning. Justifies the kit's architectural choice to separate the backend as a deliberate trade-off for async/portability.

**How to apply:** Reference when discussing future learning-agent architecture iterations; use as validation that the "separate backend" approach has real trade-offs against simpler alternatives.
