Assistant stages all preparatory work (PRs, testing, commits, package updates, CI verification). User performs final steps: tag push, live-session verification of feature gates, and shipping.

**Why:** Separates routine automation from decisions requiring human judgment; preserves user control over final release and shipping.

**How to apply:** When approaching final steps, report readiness and pause; do not execute git tag push, publish, or live verification without explicit user request.
