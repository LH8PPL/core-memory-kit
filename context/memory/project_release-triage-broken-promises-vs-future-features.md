The project uses a three-tier triage for each release milestone:
- **Broken core promise + small fix** (e.g., issue 182 searchability in v0.4.3) → Fix immediately. Core promises are non-negotiable; cheap fixes get folded into the current release.
- **New capability + large scope** (e.g., issue 184 cross-project search) → Defer to next release. Not a broken promise, just a future enhancement.
- **Open research or unsettled tradeoff** (e.g., issue 181 friction-vs-adherence) → Defer. Needs design time, not a rush fix.

**Why:** Prevents shipping false headlines (broken core promises) while protecting against scope creep from features that look important but aren't load-bearing. A small, verified fix to an existing promise is worth doing before tag; everything else belongs in the next cycle.

**How to apply:** Before each release milestone, classify each issue. Fix only small issues that break core promises. Audit the headline before tagging—"does search find your persona?"—and if the fix is <2 hours, do it.
