`validate-docs` checks ADR-NNNN, FR-N, Task N, and §N.N references but omits D-nnn (decision-log) tokens. Citations are on the honour system.

**Why:** Discovered while writing docs: user cited D-382 in commit messages before the entry existed, and drift happened within hours. Showed that unstructured citations rot.

**How to apply:** Consider expanding validator to check D-nnn format, or document the limitation so future contributors know decision-log references are not structurally enforced.
