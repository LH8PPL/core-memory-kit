Migration from current sqlite implementation to node:sqlite was evaluated and rejected based on clean CI performance data showing 10% slower search performance.

**Why:** Search is a critical operation; existing implementation met all requirements. The regression eliminated any benefit from the migration.

**How to apply:** If node:sqlite or similar sqlite replacements are reconsidered in future versions, reference this 10% regression as the data-driven decision point.
