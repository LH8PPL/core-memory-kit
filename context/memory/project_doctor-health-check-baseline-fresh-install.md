On a fresh install of claude-memory-kit (no prior sessions, distills, transcripts, or cron jobs), `cmk doctor` should report:
- **5 pass**
- **0 fail**
- **3 skip** (expected: no distill log, no transcripts, no cron jobs exist yet)

This baseline indicates HC-8 health on a fresh system.

**Why:** Distinguishes expected vs. actual health issues early in setup validation.

**How to apply:** If fresh install doctor shows 5p/0f/3s, it passes the health gate (G1 in the cut-gate). If it shows failures or unexpected skips, investigate.
