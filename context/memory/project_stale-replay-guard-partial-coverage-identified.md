**Task 234** introduces a stale-replay guard labeling `Active Threads` as *"may already be done; verify before acting"*. This prevents the injected snapshot from becoming silently outdated. **Gap:** The guard covers the injected snapshot but not the working todo list itself—in-session working lists can still diverge from memory independently.

**Why:** In this project, memory is the canonical state. Working lists can rot without active verification. The current guard is a safety net for one state path but doesn't cover working lists.

**How to apply:** Treat in-session working lists as provisional; verify against memory before acting on work items carried from prior sessions.
