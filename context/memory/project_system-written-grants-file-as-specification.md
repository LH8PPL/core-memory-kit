When Claude Code prompts instead of auto-approving (even with unchanged config), clicking "Yes" makes CC write `settings.local.json`. This file is the authoritative specification for what the new CC version expects — it documents the required matcher syntax, output fields, and exact format.

Don't guess from changelogs. Read what CC itself wrote.

**Why:** The system documents its own requirements by what it generates. The actual file is more reliable than documentation or version notes.

**How to apply:** When a new CC version rejects the old hook form, prompt user to click "Yes" once. Then read the resulting `settings.local.json` — it will show exact syntax/fields the new version requires.
