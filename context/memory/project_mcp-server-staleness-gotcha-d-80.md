When `cmk` is reinstalled during development, the long-lived MCP server process (`cmk mcp serve`) continues running the old binary. Reinstalling updates the CLI but does not restart the server. Result: live sessions query a stale server returning `unknown-scope:decisions` (or other scope-related errors) even though the feature is implemented in the current build.

**Why:** Affects feature testing and verification during development, especially when iterating on schema or scope changes. First encountered during DJ4 (v0.3.3 headline feature) testing on Jun 17.

**How to apply:** Recognize the symptom (feature works in source but returns unknown-scope in live session). Check `cmk doctor` for MCP freshness. Restart Claude Code to bind the next session to the current build. Add "restart Claude Code after reinstall" to cut-gate guides.
