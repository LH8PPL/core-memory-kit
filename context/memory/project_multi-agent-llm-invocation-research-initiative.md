Investigation targeting ~70+ repos in the multi-agent/cross-IDE ecosystem, with focus on multi-agent installers (claude-mem, Taskmaster, mimir, memex, EverOS) to map headless LLM invocation patterns. Core research question: When a project needs an LLM in headless/automated contexts, does it require (a) per-agent CLI, (b) cloud API + key, (c) agent's own headless mode, (d) other? How does each handle Windows paths?

**Why:** Findings directly inform the design of the Workflow backend selection factory and cross-OS compatibility strategy for multi-agent contexts.

**How to apply:** When research is authorized and underway, use this corpus and RQ as the targeting filter; prioritize the named installer projects; synthesize findings to inform Workflow builder architecture decisions.
