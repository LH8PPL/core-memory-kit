The kit auto-captures decisions via `cmk remember --why --how` and stores them as individual facts, but lacks a view rendering them chronologically ("show me this project's decisions in order, with their whys"). The team works around this by manually maintaining DECISION-LOG.md. Squad's `decisions.md` natively provides chronological rendering.

**Why:** That both the kit and Squad independently maintain chronological journals indicates this view type is valuable beyond individual-fact retrieval. The gap is a missed product feature—a natural extension of `cmk digest`.

**How to apply:** If implementing a decision-journal view, choose between: (a) auto-generating from facts, (b) maintaining alongside facts (like D-log), or (c) hybrid. Reference D-log and Squad as case studies.
