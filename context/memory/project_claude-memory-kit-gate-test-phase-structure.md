The cmk gate test verifies the kit through structured phases:
- **§0**: Release cut + tarball (pre-Session 1)
- **§1**: Install + doctor + file checks; gates G0–G7 (version, install, leaks, hooks, MCP, semantic) + BK1–BK4 (backend CLI, split-brain, live spawn)
- **§2**: Session 1 — live agent build in C:\Temp\cut-gate20; watches hooks fire + memory capture
- **§5**: Session 2 — recall in fresh session
- **§6**: Cold-open wedge — isolated test in C:\Temp\cut-gate-coldopen20

**Why:** Understanding the phase structure helps future sessions know what's been tested and at which stage; §0–§1 is pre-Session 1 (systematic verification), §2+ are live-agent (interactive).

**How to apply:** When working on cmk gate coverage, consult this structure to identify phase boundaries and gate assignments. Use it to understand which phases have completed and which remain.
