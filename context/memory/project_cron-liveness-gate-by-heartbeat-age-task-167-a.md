**Anacron-style heartbeat gate gated on AGE, not existence.**

The fix checks the timestamp of the last cron heartbeat rather than whether the cron process exists. A dead cron can no longer suppress the roll—the age-based gate automatically triggers next session's compaction. Prevents stale-injection and silent failures.

**Why:** Existence checks don't distinguish "never ran" from "dead." Age-based gates are resilient to process death and match production anacron behavior.

**How to apply:** For cron-managed state rotation, gate on heartbeat AGE rather than process existence. Silent failures recover automatically on next session.
