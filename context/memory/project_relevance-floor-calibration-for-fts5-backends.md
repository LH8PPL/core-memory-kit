Octopoda project research shows relevance floors must be conservative. Their 0.80 floor silently filtered 5 of 7 relevant facts before they lowered it to 0.45. For Task 233's FTS5-backed hint backend, the relevance floor should be tunable (not hardcoded) and set conservatively to avoid silently dropping relevant results.

**Why:** High floors create false negatives that go unnoticed; for retrieval, false negatives are worse than false positives. Octopoda's quantified data directly applies to our recall requirements.

**How to apply:** When implementing bm25 filtering for the hint retrieval, make the floor a configuration parameter (tunable, not baked in). Set conservatively (0.4–0.5 range) and document the precision/recall tradeoff. Test empirically on your memory corpus before deployment.
