- writeFact rebuilds INDEX.md on writes but the catch block silently swallows failures
- When hook timeout kills child mid-rebuild, INDEX drifts behind actual files with zero trace
- Silent corruption: committed INDEX.md is outdated, undetectable without audit
- Investigation ruled out: single-process race, multi-process race (8 concurrent writers tested), version differences

**Why:** Hidden failure mode caused INDEX corruption with no observable signal; was only discoverable via file audit

**How to apply:** PR #181 fix applied: failed reindex now writes INDEX_REBUILD_FAILED audit entry (observable); cmk doctor HC-4 already detects drift and guides user to cmk reindex
