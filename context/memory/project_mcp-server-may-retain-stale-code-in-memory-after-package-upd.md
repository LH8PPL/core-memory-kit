Claude Code's MCP server process may not load fresh package code until restart. CLI tools (`cmk search`, `cmk digest`) always use fresh code. Test the running server with `mk_search <query>` — success indicates fresh code; failure indicates staleness.

**Why:** Session 2 recall tests use `mk_search` (MCP server). Stale server can error even if fixes are on disk.

**How to apply:** Before Session 2, run `mk_search <query>` to test the running server. If it succeeds, server is current; if it fails, close and reopen VS Code. CLI tools work regardless.
