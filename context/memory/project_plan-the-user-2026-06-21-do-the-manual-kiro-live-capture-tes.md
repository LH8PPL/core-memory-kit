Plan (the user, 2026-06-21): do the manual Kiro live-capture test ONCE, after ALL v0.4.0 code is done (PR-1 IDE hooks merged + PR-2 CLI agent-config hooks). Batch it — one Kiro session verifies both surfaces (IDE .kiro.hook capture-fires + CLI agent-config + default-agent), rather than testing twice. So PR-2 proceeds now on code; the end-to-end 'a hook captures a real turn' verification is deferred to a single session at v0.4.0 cut. The 8-point live-test checklist (D-182) applies then.

**Why:** The user prefers one consolidated live-test session over two. PR-1 proved the hook RUNS (cmd.exe /c cmk --version → 0.3.5); the capture-fires-end-to-end test waits until PR-2 lands so both IDE + CLI surfaces are verified together at the v0.4.0 cut.

**How to apply:** Build PR-2 (50.L CLI agent-config hooks + guarded default-agent, 50.M tests) now. At v0.4.0 cut, run ONE Kiro session: install the real kit (--ide kiro), restart Kiro, IDE chat turn → verify a fact lands in context/; AND kiro-cli chat with no --agent → verify default-agent resolves + agentSpawn/stop fire. Do NOT claim 'automatic' for either surface until that session passes.
