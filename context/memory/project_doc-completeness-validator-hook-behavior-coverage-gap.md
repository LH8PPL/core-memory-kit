The `validate-doc-completeness` validator checks CLI verbs and MCP tools only.
- Hook behaviors (e.g., `preToolUse`, `postToolUse`) are not validated
- Requires manual doc review for hook-based features

**Why:** The guardrail shipped in #218 as a hook behavior but was missing from README and CLI docs. The validator only checked verb and tool coverage, not hook coverage, so the gap went undetected.

**How to apply:** When adding hook-based features, manually verify documentation completeness across README.md, docs/CLI.md, and docs/ — do not assume the validator will catch all surfaces.
