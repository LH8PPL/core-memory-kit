- **Gate 1** (FTS5 support): ✅ PASS — node:sqlite 24.4.1 ships FTS5
- **Gate 2** (sqlite-vec loading): ✅ PASS — Windows x64
- **Gate 3** (perf bake-off ≤1.03×/3% bar): ⚠️ INCONCLUSIVE — ±50% run-to-run variance; 3% threshold unmeasurable under variable load
- **Benchmark harness**: `node --experimental-sqlite scripts/bench-storage.mjs`

**Why:** Stable measurement impossible on variable dev machine. Cannot proceed without clean data (guessing or cherry-picking would be the trap).

**How to apply:** Next 141b session: prioritize stable perf measurement (quiet machine or CI integration) before deciding to migrate. Defer 141b until then.
