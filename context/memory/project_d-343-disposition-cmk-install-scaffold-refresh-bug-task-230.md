D-343 disposition SETTLED: the cmk-install-skips-existing bug (kit-owned scaffold like .claude/skills/ never refreshes on update) is filed as Task 230, laned to v0.5.5 alongside the D-337 security fix. It's a correctness bug (an updated install must reflect the current version), not deferred. Fix: installTier refreshes kit-owned dirs, keeps skip-if-exists only for user-memory tiers; + cmk doctor skill-drift detection. Proven live 2026-07-15 via test-install-refresh.mjs (staleified skill survived a re-install untouched).

**Why:** The finding was captured by auto-extract but the DISPOSITION (Task 230 + v0.5.5 lane) lived only in tasks.md/RELEASE-PLAN, not in the kit's memory — a recall query surfaced the drift between the committed docs and the memory

**How to apply:** Recall via cmk search 'install skip refresh' or --scope decisions; the settled lane is v0.5.5, Task 230
