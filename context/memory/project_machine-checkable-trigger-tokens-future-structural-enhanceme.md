D-267 notes a possible future upgrade: embed machine-checkable `fires-when:` tokens in trigger definitions to automate detection of fired triggers, replacing manual review if process scales beyond ~39 triggers or misses a fire.

**Why:** Manual walk is the current forcing function. Automation is a structural-graduation path if scale grows.

**How to apply:** Revisit in future D-entry if manual walk becomes a bottleneck or misses a fire.
