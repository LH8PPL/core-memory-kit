Use numbered test folders (`gate7`, `gate8`, etc.) to isolate each fix and validate behavior incrementally. Each gate:
- Starts fresh (`mkdir`, `git init`, `cmk install`)
- Tests a single isolated concern (bare command vs. flagged command)
- Produces a clear pass/fail signal
- Feeds into a conditional cleanup decision

**Why:** Numbered gates decouple testing from active development and make regression detection obvious. The pattern is repeatable and traceable.

**How to apply:** For the next validation cycle, use `gate9`, `gate10` etc. in `C:\Temp\`. Each gate folder's behavior determines whether to commit or roll back the corresponding code change.
