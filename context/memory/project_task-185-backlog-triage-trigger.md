Task 185 (backlog-triage) is triggered immediately after a version ships (e.g., after v0.4.3 tags + pushes). It is a deterministic pass over ~18 stuck tasks that clears the backlog.

**Why:** Automates backlog cleanup after each release, preventing accumulation of stuck tasks.

**How to apply:** When a version is released, fire Task 185 backlog-triage without delay.
