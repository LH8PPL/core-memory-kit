Kiro hooks require a Git commit + Kiro restart to become active:
- Hook config files in `.kiro/hooks/` must be committed to Git
- Changes are not reflected until Kiro is restarted after the commit
- `runCommand` exit code 0 = stdout flows to agent context; non-zero = blocks that turn
- `agentStop` event trigger fires at turn end for transcript capture

**Why:** This is the documented Kiro lifecycle. Hooks are not hot-reloaded; the cycle is part of the system design.

**How to apply:** After writing IDE hook files or modifying hook configs, commit them and restart Kiro before testing. Plan hook testing around this commit+restart requirement.
