Validators are small scripts (~30 minutes) integrated into the `npm test` suite as structural guards.
Task 128 established the pattern; Task 134 (deferred post-tag) will add a template file completeness validator following the same approach.

**Why:** Converting manual verification steps into permanent test-time guarantees catches silent failures (e.g., missing template files) early, not at user time.

**How to apply:** When adding structural checks, write a small validator script and integrate it into the test suite following the Task 128 pattern, not as a separate manual step.
