**PR #286 state:** Open and CI running
**Shipped in v0.5.2:**
- Codex adapter (#284)
- Kiro-fix (#285)
- CLI↔MCP parity fix (#286) — freshness fix + 4 parity drifts closed + process-listener leak fix (self-caught)
- Stress tests: 5/5 PASS (confirmed)
**Pending:** CI merge to main
**Remaining work:** Task 208 (Cursor+Codex interactive live-gates) — requires real agent sessions and user tokens

**Why:** Release readiness state. Future session needs to know whether #286 merged and what manual work remains for v0.5.2.

**How to apply:** Before cutting v0.5.2, confirm: (1) #286 merged to main, (2) Task 208 complete or scheduled. Once both yes, release is code-ready.
