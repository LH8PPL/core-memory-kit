**Scope (committed to RELEASE-PLAN, D-325, tasks.md header):**
- Task 196: Cursor adapter (ships; Task 208 interactive gate pending token refresh)
- Codex adapter
- Task 165: Kiro-surface fix
- Task 218: MCP index freshness

**Excluded (off-theme):**
- Tasks 223, 224 (privacy judge / server-side; Task 224 is SonarCloud web-UI fix, confirmed non-blocker)

**Startup workflow (when user approves):**
1. Branch off fresh main
2. Read Task-50 seam + cross-agent research note (per read-docs-first rule)
3. Build `defineAgentProfile` Cursor data declaration
4. Implement Codex adapter, Task 165, Task 218
5. Build Task 208 interactive Cursor gate; flag for user's live run once tokens refresh (~2026-07-24)

**Why:** One-theme batching honors differentiator rule; scope committed to source-of-truth docs; workflow prevents context-switch churn

**How to apply:** When user approves start, follow workflow step-by-step; Task 208 gate waits on user token refresh, not a build blocker
