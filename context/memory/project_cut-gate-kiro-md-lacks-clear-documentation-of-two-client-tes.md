- **Problem**: The guide's title ("cut-gate-kiro", singular) and session numbering (1/2/3) obscure that Session 2 switches from IDE to CLI. Readers expecting an "IDE gate" may be confused.
- **Proposed fixes** (per assistant, pending confirmation):
  - Rename section headers: "§2 Session 1 (Kiro IDE)", "§5 Session 2 (kiro-cli)", "§6 Session 3 (cold-open, either client)"
  - Add a one-line "two clients, three sessions" map at the top of §2.

**Why:** Clear documentation prevents confusion and sets correct expectations for gate runners.

**How to apply:** Apply clarity edits to cut-gate-kiro.md before running §5 and §6.
