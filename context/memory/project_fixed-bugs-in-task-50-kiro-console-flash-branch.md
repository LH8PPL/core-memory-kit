- D-190: Console popup bug (fixed)
- D-191: Uninstall husks bug — kit-only files not fully removed (fixed + live-verified)
- D-191/B1: Regex data-loss bug — could have deleted users' steering notes; caught in skill-review before ship (fixed + live-verified)
- All 3 fixes awaiting stress test completion (5/5) before PR/CI/merge

**Why:** Uninstall correctness and data-loss prevention are critical; these fixes are verified and ready

**How to apply:** Reference D-191/B1 (the data-loss regex) when reviewing uninstall PRs or testing; know these three are known-good in this branch
