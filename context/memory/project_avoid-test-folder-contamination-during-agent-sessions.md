Running CLI checks inside a test folder while an agent is actively running pollutes turn-files with non-user content. The auto-extract system correctly identifies contaminated turns (outputs `nothing_durable`), but this can appear as a false bug. Solution: Keep CLI verification outside the test folder; run verification after the agent session completes.

**Why:** Previous Kiro gate rounds confused contamination artifacts with extraction system bugs.

**How to apply:** Use a three-phase pattern for agent tests: (1) run agent session, (2) exit agent, (3) run CLI verification. Don't mix phases.
