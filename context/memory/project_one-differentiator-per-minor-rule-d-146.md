Each minor release (v0.X) ships one headline differentiator. Mixing two differentiators (e.g., Kiro + persona-redesign) violates this rule and creates the "squat on the minor" anti-pattern that D-146 was designed to prevent.

**Why:** Keeps release scope clear and focused. Violations delay both features and diffuse impact.

**How to apply:** When considering adding a feature to a minor already committed to a different differentiator, reject the fold-in unless explicitly re-prioritizing (a deliberate decision to change the minor's headline).
