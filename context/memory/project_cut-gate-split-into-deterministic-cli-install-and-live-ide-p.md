- **Deterministic (§0–§1)**: tarball build, install+doctor, package-rename path, privacy leak screen, config-dir resolution, CLI verb wiring, guard-memory bin — all runnable in isolation / CI
- **Live (§2–§9)**: real Claude Code session, Stop hook capture/auto-extract, fresh session recall, cold-open habits — requires IDE integration
- For rename-only cuts, deterministic gates + real daily use suffice (live gates re-test unchanged features)

**Why:** Distinguish which gates can run in automation vs which need real IDE session; guides scope for release types

**How to apply:** Before cutting, run §0–§1 gates; for feature-heavy cuts also drive §2–§9; for rename-only, deterministic pass + real usage is sufficient to proceed
