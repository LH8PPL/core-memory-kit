1. Merge PR #257 (Task 201 — split-brain backend)
2. Assistant runs `npm run release -- 0.4.5` (CHANGELOG finalization, package.json bump, auto-commit)
3. User pushes `v0.4.5` tag (triggers publish.yml → npm publish + GitHub Release)

Both Task 200 (PR #256, D-270 backend fix) and Task 201 (PR #257, split-brain backend) are merged into main, ready for v0.4.5.

**Why:** Separation of concerns: assistant automates release mechanics; user retains explicit control over publish trigger. Prevents accidental publishes.

**How to apply:** When cutting v0.4.5, execute these steps in order. For future releases, follow the same pattern.
