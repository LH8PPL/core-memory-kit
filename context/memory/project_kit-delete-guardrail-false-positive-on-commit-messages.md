Guardrail fires on commit messages containing "Remove-Item" near memory-path text, even in commits that document (not execute) destructive changes. Design is intentional: false blocks are recoverable; false allows cause data loss.

**Why:** Prioritizes safety over user friction

**How to apply:** When writing commits for memory/tier changes, avoid "Remove-Item" + memory-path combinations in the message; use synonyms or restructure message if needed.
