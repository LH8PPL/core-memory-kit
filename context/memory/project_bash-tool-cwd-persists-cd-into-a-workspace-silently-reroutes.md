The Bash tool's working directory PERSISTS across calls within a session — a `cd packages/cli` earlier makes a later bare `npm test` run the CLI WORKSPACE's test script (6 tests, writes packages/cli/.test-logs/last-run.json), not the root suite (1800+ tests, root .test-logs/last-run.json). Reading the root last-run.json then shows stale/wrong counts. The PowerShell tool does NOT have this problem (it auto-resets to the project root each call).

**Why:** Burned ~two cycles this session reading 6-passed and a packages/cli error path as if they were the root suite; the cause was a persisted cd from an earlier inspect command, not a real failure.

**How to apply:** In the Bash tool, prefix root-suite commands with `cd /c/Projects/claude-memory-kit &&` (the CLAUDE.md guidance says prefer absolute paths / avoid relying on persisted cd). Or just use the PowerShell tool for `npm test`/`npm run stress`, which always runs from the project root.
