Raw evidence from the 2026-07-01 research arc exists in session temp files (4 files, ~420 KB):
- `w3kewobmy.output` — comparative-judgment study (152 KB)
- `w7du3zbva.output` — full-field survey with 79-system enumeration (134 KB)
- `wn7itsb41.output` — wave-2 deep-reads (69 KB)
- `wwm9i2k4d.output` — original 9-system analysis (68 KB)

Each contains verbatim code quotes, exact file:line references, per-system analyses, and transferability verdicts. Synthesis notes state: "trusting the agents' verbatim quotes" — meaning they depend on raw evidence for auditability. Files are at-risk (session temp, eventual garbage collection). Re-generation cost: ~4M tokens.

**Why:** Kit design requires decision-trail preservation and evidence-linked claims. Losing raw evidence breaks auditability — a future reader can't verify claims trace to real findings. Synthesis notes are valuable; raw evidence is the ground truth.

**How to apply:** **Preservation:** Commit as `docs/research/raw/2026-07-01-{artifact}/`, register as frozen, and update citation links. Maintains traceability forever. **Synthesis-only:** Accept expiry, document as a design boundary. Choose based on your evidence-preservation philosophy.
