Perf optimization discovered during self-review. Initial implementation checked mtime of newest `type:project` fact (130ms). Changed to check only `INDEX.md` mtime (instant) because CMK already maintains INDEX.md on every save. This proxy is authoritative without iterating all 307 fact files.

**Why:** Session-start budget is tight; INDEX.md is a required artifact maintained by kit infrastructure anyway.

**How to apply:** `isJournalStale()` compares DECISIONS.md mtime vs INDEX.md mtime. If journal is older, sync runs on session start.
