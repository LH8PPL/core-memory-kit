- Single-writer model: the scheduler writes the heartbeat; no other component modifies it
- Two surfaces: write (scheduler records heartbeat) separate from read (module checks freshness)
- Freshness check by age, never existence: verdict based on elapsed time since last heartbeat, not whether marker exists
- Diagnostics surface raw value: health/status commands expose the heartbeat timestamp, separate from verdict logic

**Why:** OpenWolf peer code validates heartbeat design patterns; these patterns should inform any cron-liveness module interface

**How to apply:** when building cron-health checks, follow single-writer + age-threshold design; separate diagnostic output from verdict logic
