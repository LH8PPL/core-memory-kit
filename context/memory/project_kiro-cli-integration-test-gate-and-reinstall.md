Live integration environment for validating memory persistence:
- **Gate location**: `C:\Temp\kiro-cli-gate`
- **Reinstall command** (run from within gate): `cmk install --ide kiro`
- **Test pattern**: Launch `kiro-cli chat`, state a preference, verify it lands in `context/`
- **Validation**: Facts should appear in `C:\Temp\kiro-cli-gate\context\` after the interactive session

**Why:** Interactive session testing is the authoritative proof of memory persistence. Code inspection alone is insufficient.

**How to apply:** Use kiro-cli as the integration harness for all memory-related fixes. After rebuild+reinstall, run a live chat session and check that the stated preference persists to the context/ folder.
