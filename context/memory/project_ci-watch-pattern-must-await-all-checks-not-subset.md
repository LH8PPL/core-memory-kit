A proper watch waits for all check-runs (including Sonar) to complete. An earlier loop keyed only on ci.yml and exited prematurely, missing Sonar completion.

**Why:** Sonar is a blocking check; partial watches give false "all green" signals

**How to apply:** When confirming CI settlement, use a pattern that explicitly waits for every check-run, not a filtered subset
