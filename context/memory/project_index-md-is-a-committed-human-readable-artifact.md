- INDEX.md is the authoritative index of fact files in the project
- It is committed to git and travels with the clone
- It is a FEATURE, not a disposable cache

**Why:** INDEX is part of the project's shipped state; users rely on it staying current and human-readable

**How to apply:** Treat INDEX.md as first-class; do not gitignore; keep it synchronized with actual fact files via cmk doctor or reindex
