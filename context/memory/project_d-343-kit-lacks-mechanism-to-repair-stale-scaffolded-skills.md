The kit has no command (e.g., `cmk repair --skills`) to fix skills that become stale when templates are updated. This is a general gap: cascading updates are not automated.

**Why:** Without this, updates to shipped skill templates don't propagate to existing scaffolded instances. Manual intervention is required, defeating the kit's purpose.

**How to apply:** Propose D-343 as a forward fix; in the meantime, document the limitation and offer template diffs + manual copy as the workaround.
