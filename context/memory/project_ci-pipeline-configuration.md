The project runs 6 automated workflows on each PR merge; all must pass for green status:
- CI (test suite)
- cross-OS install matrix
- canonicalize parity
- CodeQL
- Security
- SonarCloud

**Why:** These define what "CI is green" means in this repo; understanding the full matrix is essential for release QA, troubleshooting, and future expansion

**How to apply:** When evaluating CI status or proposing new validation steps, reference this as the baseline
