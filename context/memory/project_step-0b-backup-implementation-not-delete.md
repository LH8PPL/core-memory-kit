- Moves `~/.claude-memory-kit` + stray `~/context/` to `C:\cut-gate-backups\user-tier_<stamp>`
- Includes restore note for recovery
- Replaces previous delete behavior for gate Step 0b

**Why:** Implements the standing backup-not-wipe rule for the gate process (user explicitly preferred this over deletion)

**How to apply:** When running v0.4.1+ gate, Step 0b auto-archives instead of deleting. No manual action needed; archive is reversible via restore note.
