The project maintains a "paper trail" consisting of three synchronized components:
- **DECISION-LOG**: Records decisions (e.g., D-270, D-271) and rationale.
- **tasks.md**: The authoritative task status file; must always reflect actual code state and decision-log decisions.
- **RELEASE-PLAN**: Tracks blocked releases (e.g., v0.4.5 blocked on Task 200).

Drift occurs when tasks.md lags behind the decision log or actual code state. This session: tasks.md hadn't been updated to reflect that the recursion guard and KiroCliBackend were done, or the D-271 deep-research gate. Now fixed.

**Why:** The project relies on tasks.md as the canonical reference for task status; stale entries break the single-source-of-truth principle and risk decisions being missed or contradicted.

**How to apply:** After any major decision, code completion, or blocker, update the corresponding task entry in tasks.md to match the current state. Before moving forward, verify tasks.md reflects the decision log and actual work state.
