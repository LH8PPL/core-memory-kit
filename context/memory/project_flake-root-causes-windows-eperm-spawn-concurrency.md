Two non-product flakes identified and root-caused:
- pack-completeness: `npm pack` spawn retry issue
- capture-turn teardown: best-effort cleanup race

Root cause class: Windows-EPERM / spawn-concurrency

**Why:** Prevents false CI negatives; establishes these as environmental quirks, not code defects.

**How to apply:** If similar flakes recur, check Windows spawn-concurrency; consider retry hardening or cleanup ordering if frequency rises.
