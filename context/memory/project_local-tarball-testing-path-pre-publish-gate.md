Before publishing to npm, validate via `npm pack` → uninstall global → `npm install -g ./tarball.tgz` → verify with health checks. This avoids premature npm publish and tests against the real packaged artifact.

**Why:** Catches bugs before they reach npm; reduces risk of bad versions going public; aligns with established cut-gate.md pattern, proven effective for v0.3.5.

**How to apply:** Treat cut-gate.md testing workflow as the primary verification gate; consult it before suggesting publish-first alternatives.
