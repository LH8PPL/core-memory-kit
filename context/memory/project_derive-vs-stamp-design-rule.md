Derive state when the work's product already encodes it (e.g., artifact mtimeMs encodes "a run happened"); stamp explicitly only when a signal is essential but NOT encoded in products (e.g., cron liveness heartbeat). Grounded in GNU make §4.8 and ADR-0002.

**Why:** ADR-0002 prefers state encoded in artifacts; explicit markers should be minimal and justified. Reduces marker bloat and keeps artifacts as source of truth.

**How to apply:** Ask: does the artifact encode this? If yes, derive. If no and essential, add minimal stamped marker. Example: `recent.md` freshness derives from mtimeMs; `last_heartbeat` stamps for cron liveness.
