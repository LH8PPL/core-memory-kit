`touchCooldownMarker` currently fires on both success and failure from 5 callers, causing failed Haiku calls to incorrectly block the next compress for 120s even though they didn't spend budget.

**Why:** This is the 167.F sibling bug discovered in audit. Failed calls shouldn't trigger cooldown blocking since they didn't consume resources and should be allowed to retry.

**How to apply:** When reasoning about cooldown design and the stale-content sync-drain, remember the current behavior blocks retries after failures. The proposed fix (5a) is to touch the marker only on successful compresses, never in catch blocks.
