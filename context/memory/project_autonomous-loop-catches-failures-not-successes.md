The loop **reliably dampens memories behind autonomous failures** (failed commands, contradictions, PREDICTION: MISS)—no human trigger needed.

It **cannot reliably signal successful autonomous writes within-session**; success is silent. A memory's actual value only surfaces **next session** when it's recalled: helpful (silent) or contradicted (dampened).

The loop can self-correct failures autonomously, but cannot self-confirm successes in real time.

**Why:** Asymmetry is architectural, not a limitation: predictions and tool-resolutions fire now, but confirmation only arrives when memory is *used* later.

**How to apply:** Autonomous tasks should register PREDICTION: lines so failures are loud. Expect successes to validate only when recalled in future sessions.
