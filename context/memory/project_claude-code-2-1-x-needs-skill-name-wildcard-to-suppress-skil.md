Claude Code 2.1.x changed skill-permission matching: the bare Skill(<name>) allow-list rule alone NO LONGER suppresses the "Use skill?" approval prompt — it now ALSO needs the Skill(<name>:*) wildcard form. Ground truth: when a user clicks "allow for this project", Claude Code itself writes BOTH Skill(memory-write) AND Skill(memory-write:*) into settings.local.json. The kit (settings-hooks.mjs KIT_ALLOW) now writes both forms for memory-write + memory-search. settings.json is still honored (permissions merge across settings.json + settings.local.json). The Skill() permission syntax is UNDOCUMENTED in the CC docs (a confirmed gap) — CC's own write-behavior is the spec.

**Why:** The v0.4.1 cut-gate caught the kit's prompt-free capture breaking on CC 2.1.191 — the bare Skill(memory-write) the kit shipped since Task 90 stopped working. This is upstream format drift the kit must track (like Kiro hook formats), and it's invisible to unit tests (no test drives a live CC skill-approval), so only the live gate caught it.

**How to apply:** When allow-listing a skill for Claude Code, write BOTH Skill(<name>) AND Skill(<name>:*). If a 'Use skill?' prompt appears despite an allow entry, check whether CC wrote a settings.local.json with the :* form (that's the tell). The Skill() syntax is undocumented, so verify against what CC writes itself, not the docs. Re-check this on future CC version bumps — skill-permission matching has changed before and may again.
