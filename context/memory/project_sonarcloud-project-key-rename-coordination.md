When renaming a GitHub repository, the SonarCloud project key must be updated in a coordinated sequence to avoid CI failures. **Sequence** (do not reverse): (1) Rename the key in SonarCloud dashboard (Administration → Update Key), confirm it exists; (2) Update sonar-project.properties in the repo to match; (3) Commit and merge. If config is committed before the server-side key exists, scans fail because the client targets a non-existent project key.

**Why:** SonarCloud and local configuration must remain in sync. Pushing config before server-side key is renamed creates a gap where scans fail with 404/not-found.

**How to apply:** Before committing sonar-project.properties changes, verify the new key exists and is active on SonarCloud's dashboard. Always perform server-side rename first.
