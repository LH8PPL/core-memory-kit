Each agent definition includes role-scoped binding rules:
  - TDD, five doors, honest work-report format
  - No git operations (clone, push, commit, branch management)
  - No memory-file edits (memory state remains with lead)
  - Mechanic (Sonnet) must stop-and-report on judgment calls
  - Merge decisions and git state stay with lead

**Why:** Keeps deployment, memory, and decision authority centralized; preserves audit trail.

**How to apply:** Review agent outputs for compliance with these rules; do not remove them without explicit decision.
