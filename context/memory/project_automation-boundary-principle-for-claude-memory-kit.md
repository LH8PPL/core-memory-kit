The kit should automate everything in its domain (capture, indexing, recall, curation) and nothing in the user's domain. Specifically, memory facts must NOT auto-commit to git; the user must review before publication. Git commits represent authorship and publication — a tool that auto-commits in the user's voice is a liability.

**Why:** Every auto-committing tool eventually has the "it committed something I didn't want" problem. Memory systems have observer-effect dynamics — discussing the system changes it. The correct gate is human review before publication, not automation of the user's authorship surface.

**How to apply:** When designing new kit features, distinguish kit-controlled operations (fully automate) from user-controlled operations (add review gates). Keep the human at the publish gate. Document this boundary principle in design docs.
