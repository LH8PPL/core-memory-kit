The memory system (claude-memory-kit) auto-injects saved memory entries on the next session start. This mechanism is being dogfooded in this very project — Task 148's resume plan was saved in memory `P-L7C2aAaa` and will be auto-injected when the next session begins.

**Why:** Understanding this mechanism helps explain why the resume plan doesn't need to be manually re-read; the system handles handoff automatically. This is a core feature of the kit being built.

**How to apply:** On next session, the resume memory `P-L7C2aAaa` will be available in context. Use it immediately to continue Task 148 without re-reading prior conversation.
