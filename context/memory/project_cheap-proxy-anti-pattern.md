- Recurring failure: accepting cheap proxies (grep count, single directory, cloned subset) as ground truth for actual metrics
- Proxy is easy to compute but doesn't measure what it claims
- User strength: caught 4 of 5 instances this session

**Why:** Led to undercounting of prior art and false confidence in incomplete scans.

**How to apply:** When measuring, verify the proxy actually measures the target before treating as ground truth. Use direct measurement or widen scope if unsure.
