When a feature deliberately defers or does NOT build something (e.g., `cmk restore`), document in `tasks.md` the *rationale*, not just the deferral. Example: "`cmk restore` deliberately not built — read flag + archive file cover recovery; un-tombstone is write-path with reindex/composition surface deserving its own task."

**Why:** Future reader (or user months later) understands the decision and won't re-open the question or accidentally build the deferred feature in ad-hoc ways.

**How to apply:** Pair "what's deferred" with "why" in scope docs; treat tasks.md as a decision log, not a checklist.
