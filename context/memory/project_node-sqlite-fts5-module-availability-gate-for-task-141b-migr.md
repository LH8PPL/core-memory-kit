When evaluating node:sqlite migration (Task 141b spike), FTS5 module availability across platforms is a required validation gate. `better-sqlite3` ships FTS5 compiled in by default; `node:sqlite` may not on all platforms. This constraint must be verified as part of the 141b spike work alongside perf bake-off and sqlite-vec loadExtension tests.

**Why:** Task 141b is conditional on three spikes. Without confirming FTS5 is available on all target platforms, the migration could pass in controlled dev/test environments but fail in production.

**How to apply:** Include FTS5 module availability as an explicit test/validation gate when scoping and executing the 141b spike work.
