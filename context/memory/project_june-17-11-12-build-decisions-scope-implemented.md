Current installed `cmk` binary includes: (1) zod enum validation for search scopes (including `decisions`), (2) `DECISIONS.md` support with `decision (retracted)` status, (3) `cmk search --scope decisions` query support. Stale MCP processes from Jun 15 predate this build and block scope resolution.

**Why:** Distinguishes current-build capabilities from stale-process behavior when testing scope-based features.

**How to apply:** When testing decision-scope features, verify MCP process is current via `cmk doctor` or by restarting Claude Code.
