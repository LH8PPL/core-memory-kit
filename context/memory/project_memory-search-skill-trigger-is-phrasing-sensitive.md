- Fires on canonical phrasing: "what did we decide about [X]?"
- Does not fire on structural questions ("how is this project structured?") — crawls code instead
- Underlying mechanism (skill, MCP, cmk search) works correctly when triggered
- Root cause: trigger description tuned to exact canonical phrasing, not broader recall-shaped questions

**Why:** Explains variance in early test runs; clarifies this is a trigger-detection polish issue (fixable), not mechanism failure (blocker)

**How to apply:** Use "what did we decide about..." phrasing to reliably invoke memory-search. Or expand trigger description to cover variations like "where does X live", "how is X structured", "what are my rules for X"
