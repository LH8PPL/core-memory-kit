**Task 74 (Live Auto-Compaction):** Trigger a real auto-compact in a long session, confirm the snapshot reappears. Unit/integration tests + code verified; live compaction behavior cannot be auto-tested in CI.

**Task 151 (In-Chat Promotion Relay & MCP):** Verify optional promotion mention relay and `mk_lessons_promote` topic-routing in a live MCP session with Claude. Unit/integration + code verified; in-chat agent behavior cannot be auto-tested in CI.

**Why:** Features depend on runtime agent/session state that cannot be simulated. Honest caveats prevent over-claiming automation; live verification required before production.

**How to apply:** Before shipping a release with Tasks 74 or 151: (1) trigger Task 74 compaction in real session, confirm snapshot re-injects; (2) test Task 151 promotion relay + routing in live MCP session.
