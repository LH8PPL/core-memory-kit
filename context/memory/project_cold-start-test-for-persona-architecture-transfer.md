To verify persona facts about backend architecture transfer to new projects, perform a fresh cold-start test:
1. Create fresh directory: `mkdir C:\Temp\<test-name>; cd C:\Temp\<test-name>`
2. Initialize: `git init; cmk install --with-semantic`
3. Open in VS Code; request: "Start a new Python backend — set up the structure"
4. Evaluate signals:
   - **Partial signal:** Layered architecture appears in framework options (routes, services, repositories mentioned explicitly)
   - **Full confirmation:** Generated scaffold creates `app/{api,services,repositories,schemas}/` directory structure

**Why:** Tests whether persona facts not only transfer to new projects but are actually applied in generation. Confirms memory drainage/promotion system works end-to-end, not just at storage level.

**How to apply:** Run this procedure after changes to persona facts to verify the change is working correctly before declaring success.
