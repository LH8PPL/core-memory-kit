**Status:** Code complete and green (10/10 tests), paused on branch `task-210-deletion-propagation`
**Delivered so far:**
- deletion-propagation.mjs: cascade check (tombstoned facts verified gone from SQLite + recent.md/archive.md/today-*.md)
- HC-12 in cmk doctor: health check for cascade verification (currently fails naming surviving file + fact id, vacuously skips when nothing was forgotten)
- daily-distill forward-path screen: fresh summary drops already-tombstoned content
**Remaining work:** doc walk (HEALTH-CHECKS.md HC-12 row, lifecycle-map G-table, design.md, CLI.md, CHANGELOG, tasks.md, DECISION-LOG), full suite + stress, live-test, two-pass review, PR

**Why:** Current work-in-progress showing typical task completion path and phase sequence.

**How to apply:** Resume at doc walk phase; know that test suite is complete and likely passes stress testing too before docs begin.
