Task 50 adapter architecture: do NOT build a uniform Installer base class across agents (claude-mem proved it breaks when agents differ in format/mechanism). The reusable seam is a shared tested mutateAgentConfig primitive (touch-only-our-keys, refuse-to-clobber-on-parse-error, idempotent changed-boolean) + per-agent metadata as DATA not classes. No other product in our 66-note corpus solved core-identical-plus-thin-per-agent-wiring cleanly.

**Why:** Full-corpus survey: only claude-mem actually multi-agent-installs and its code is bespoke-per-agent; an Installer.install() interface is a leaky abstraction whose bodies share zero code. The generalizable part is the config-write primitive, which maps to the kit's existing marker-block byte-preservation + over-mutation-guard rules.

**How to apply:** Build mutateAgentConfig(path, format json|yaml|toml, keyPath, entry, {merge|replace}) FIRST with an over-mutation test (seed N, mutate one, assert N-1). Per-agent profiles are data records (instructionFile/mcpConfigPath/mcpFormat/mcpServersKey/hookMechanism/eventMap). Do NOT registry-ize the matrix yet (single-digit N).
