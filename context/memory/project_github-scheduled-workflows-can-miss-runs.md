GitHub's shared cron pool is not 100% reliable; scheduled runs may never execute. In this cycle, the watch's first run never happened, leaving a HIGH advisory undetected until a PR tripped the gate.

**Why:** Time-sensitive checks (dependency scanning, security advisories) must have a backstop to ensure they run even if the cron pool drops the cycle.

**How to apply:** Add a secondary scheduled time, or accept manual workflow dispatch as the primary backstop for critical time-sensitive checks.
