- **3 YES (ship failure learning):** memclaw (code), ReasoningBank (code), MemRL (paper)
- **1 PARTIAL:** ReMe (paper only; dropped in shipped repo)
- **5 NO (store-and-retrieve only):** mem0, letta, graphiti, MemOS, A-Mem
- **Critical finding:** 3 systems (letta, MemOS, A-Mem) define fields (`Step.feedback`, `usefulness_score`, `retrieval_count`) but leave them inert — the industry builds the socket and doesn't plug anything in.

**Why:** Establishes kit's position relative to precedent and identifies the real gap (inertness, not absence of fields).

**How to apply:** Reference when designing failure-learning mechanism or justifying ADR-0017 scope. memclaw is the only oracle-free reference architecture.
