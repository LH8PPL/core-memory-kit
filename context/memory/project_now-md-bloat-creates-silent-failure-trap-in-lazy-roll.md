The lazy `now.md` → `today` roll mechanism (Task 105) has a failure mode at scale:
- **Symptom:** When `now.md` grows to ~400 KB, the roll silently fails (times out, cooldown-skips, or fails without error)
- **Trap:** Once bloated, `now.md` never self-heals; the lazy roll never succeeds again
- **Recovery:** `cmk-compress-session` manual command restores health (410 KB → 1.4 KB in observed case)
- **Root cause:** The bloated state exceeds the roll's timeout/resource budget; cooldown mechanism prevents retry; no fallback self-repair kicks in

**Why:** Future sessions may encounter stale injected context because the roll failed silently. Diagnosing this requires understanding the trap; recovery requires knowing about the manual command. This is critical for session health troubleshooting.

**How to apply:** If session startup shows stale injected context, check `now.md` size. If >100 KB, run `cmk-compress-session` before assuming other bugs. Task 167 (v0.4.x) will prevent this trap by adding size-triggered roll + bounded compression.
