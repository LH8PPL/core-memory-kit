kiro-cli `preToolUse` hook matchers are **literal strings only** — regex and pipe-alternation syntax will silently fail.

Example:
- ❌ Broken: `'execute_bash|executeBash|shell'` (treated as literal string, matches nothing)
- ✅ Fixed: `'*'` (matches all tools)

The delete-guardrail was non-functional because its matcher used unsupported syntax.

**Why:** PR #224 discovered this during guardrail testing; the bug went undetected until explicitly tested, confirming it was a critical cut-blocker.

**How to apply:** When writing kiro-cli `preToolUse` hooks, use only literal strings or `'*'`. Do NOT use regex or pipe-alternation syntax.
