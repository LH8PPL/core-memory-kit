Anti-stalling directive (the user, 2026-07-23): 'we had it for 6 weeks and nothing, like alot of things we defered it for no reason. now i want to be decisive and just do it, no more stalling things.' When the user engages with a parked/deferred item, the default motion is LANE IT into a committed version slot, not refresh its trigger. 'Parked >1 minor AND the user re-raised it' = automatic lane-it signal. Does not overturn D-248's trigger discipline for untouched items; it biases boundary cases toward commitment.

**Why:** Six weeks of parked-viewer (D-121) with demand evidence and zero motion is the precedent; deferral-by-default was costing real features

**How to apply:** At any deferral decision the user participates in: propose a lane, not a trigger; reserve triggers for items nobody has re-raised
