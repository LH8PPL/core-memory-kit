The core-memory-kit requires explicit folder trust in VS Code to function. Without it, VS Code ignores installed permissions and blocks the kit's background write operations.

To grant trust: Open the project folder in VS Code. When prompted "Do you trust this workspace?", click **Yes**. (Alternatively, a CLI one-liner is available in SETUP docs or previous installation instructions.)

**Why:** Kit's background memory jobs require write access. This was discovered during migration when permission popups appeared until trust was granted.

**How to apply:** After kit installation/migration, if write permission errors appear later, ensure the folder is trusted in VS Code.
