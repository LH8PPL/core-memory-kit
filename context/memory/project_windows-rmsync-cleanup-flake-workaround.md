For Windows `rmSync` EPERM race flakes in test teardown (e.g., `cli-install.test.js`), apply `maxRetries: 10, retryDelay: 100` to cleanup code.

Implementation: 3-line fix distributed across three cleanup sites in the affected test file(s).

**Why:** Windows CI experiences non-deterministic EPERM races during teardown; this pattern is established in the codebase and avoids deep refactoring.

**How to apply:** When test teardown fails with `rmSync` EPERM on Windows, apply this retry pattern to the affected cleanup sites rather than investigating the underlying race.
