The kit treats any cwd as a potential project root and scaffolds memory tiers accordingly. This exposes artifact classes that standard .gitignore patterns don't cover (e.g., agent-scaffolded memory, stray `.core-memory-kit/` directories). A name guard caught a stray artifact before this session.

**Why:** The exposure is real and undefended. Formalizing a guard closes the gap and prevents accidental commits of kit-specific scaffolding.

**How to apply:** For v0.6.2, design a guard that detects and rejects kit-scaffolded artifact names (`.core-memory-kit/`, `.agents/`, etc.) to prevent false positives when the kit runs in non-project directories.
