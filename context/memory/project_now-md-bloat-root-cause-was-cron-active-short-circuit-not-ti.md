The now.md bloat (410 KB) that froze the injected snapshot was caused by the lazy roll being GATED OUT, not failing: detectStaleness short-circuits to cron-active on the mere existence of the cron-registered sentinel (above the bloat check), but the host cron never actually ran (registered "Ready", LastRunTime blank). The fallback deferred to a dead primary. Confirmed from lazy-compress.log — skipped every SessionStart, never a timeout.

**Why:** I first guessed "the Haiku roll timed out on 410 KB" and wrote that into the task. Reading lazy-compress.log corrected me: the roll was SKIPPED every time (cron-active, then cooldown), never attempted. A registered-but-dead cron disabled the only working compression path. This is the "did you check the primary source?" lesson applied to a root-cause claim — the log is the primary source; my recall was wrong.

**How to apply:** When diagnosing why an automated path didn't run, read its OWN log before theorizing about failure modes. A "skipped" log entry (never ran) is a different bug class from a "timed out" entry (ran, failed). The fix is Task 167.A: cron-active may only short-circuit if the cron actually ran recently, not just because the sentinel exists. A sentinel that disables a fallback must verify the primary is alive.
