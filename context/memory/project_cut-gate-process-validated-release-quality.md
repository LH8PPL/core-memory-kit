The cut-gate—a multi-gate validation run before shipping—caught three real bugs in v0.3.2 before release:
- DJ2 journal-idempotency issue
- js-yaml CVE (security vulnerability)
- get-reads-tombstones documentation bug
All gates passed green; all bugs were fixed before npm publication.

**Why:** Cut-gate is the quality checkpoint that prevents bugs from reaching users. This session proved it catches real problems—it earned its keep.

**How to apply:** Run complete cut-gate before every release. Do not skip or bypass gates; they protect release quality. All gates must be green.
