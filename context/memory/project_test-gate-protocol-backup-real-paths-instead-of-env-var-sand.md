**Goal**: Test kiro CLI against real user directories (not env-var sandboxed), so the gate catches real-world path bugs and proves the default behavior works.

**Protocol**:
1. **Before gate**: Back up `~/.claude-memory-kit/` (Move) and `~/.aws/` (Copy — creds-sensitive).
2. **During gate**: Run all tests against real paths — no MEMORY_KIT_AWS_DIR / MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR env vars.
3. **After gate**: Preserve test artifacts in backup folder as evidence, then restore originals.
4. **Restore `.aws` special case**: Delete only the cmk agent files added (`q_cli_default.json`, `cmk.json`); never move/remove the whole dir (would break concurrent AWS tools).

**Open**: Verify kiro-cli actually reads `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/` (per D-182), not `~/.kiro/`.

**Why:** Testing real default paths catches real-world bugs that env-var sandboxing hides — the same principle as the "test real input" rule.

**How to apply:** Rewrite cut-gate-kiro.md; strip all MEMORY_KIT_AWS_DIR / MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR refs; add backup-real-restore protocol section.
