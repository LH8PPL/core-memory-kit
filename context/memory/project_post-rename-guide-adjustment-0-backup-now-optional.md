The cut-gate guide's §0 step assumes backing up `~/.claude-memory-kit` (old path). After rename to `.core-memory-kit`:
  - Old path already backed up (renamed to `.claude-memory-kit.backup`)
  - New path is clean (`~/.core-memory-kit` intentionally absent)
  - §0 can be skipped; start at §1 "Scaffold + read every file"

**Why:** Path migration makes the original §0 step redundant; tier setup is already complete.

**How to apply:** In future gate runs with users, note that §0 backup is satisfied by the rename work; direct them straight to §1.
