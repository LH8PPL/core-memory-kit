- **Kiro IDE** (GUI) — hooks defined in `.kiro/hooks/*.json` (Stop, UserPromptSubmit, PreToolUse, PostToolUse)
- **kiro-cli** (terminal) — hooks defined in `~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json` (agentSpawn, stop) + default-agent registration
- A single `cmk install --ide kiro` command wires both clients, but they operate independently with different hook mechanisms.

**Why:** Both clients are installed and available; they must be tested separately because a bug or feature that works in one may not work in the other. Default-agent resolution (D-182) is an example of a CLI-only issue.

**How to apply:** When designing workflows or test plans involving kiro, remember that the IDE and CLI are two surfaces. Any comprehensive testing must include both. If only one client is installed, that is a valid limitation to document.
