claude-memory-kit development runs on subscription billing. API calls have no marginal token cost, unlike per-API-call billing.

**Why:** Removes token cost as a gating factor when designing testing strategy. Tests can be gated on wall-clock time and rate-limits instead of cost.

**How to apply:** When deciding whether to run expensive tests (e.g., live agent-loop) in CI or pre-merge gates, prioritize speed and rate-limits over cost. Keep the shipped product's Haiku calls economical for end-users who may be on API billing.
