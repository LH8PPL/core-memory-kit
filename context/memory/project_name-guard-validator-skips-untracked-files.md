The name-guard validator in CI does not scan untracked files. This gap allowed sensitive content in wiki/raw/ to bypass validation. Task 214 filed to fix it.

**Why:** Incident D-310: content in an untracked wiki/raw/ path leaked through CI without being caught by the name guard.

**How to apply:** Until Task 214 is resolved, assume untracked files bypass name-guard validation. Be explicit about which files must be scanned, or track them in git.
