- MEMORY.md serves as a bounded, actively-loaded index artifact (capped size, hot in session context)
- Fact files (unbounded size) store detailed content, routed via MEMORY.md reference
- INDEX.md or similar metadata preserves causality chains — supersede relationships, historical edges between facts
- This design unifies efficient retrieval (hot index) with large-scale persistence (fact files) without forcing tradeoffs

**Why:** The pattern scales to large corpora while keeping session context tractable. Multiple independent research efforts converged on this design, validating the approach.

**How to apply:** When extending or refactoring memory system, treat MEMORY.md as routing surface, fact files as content store, and INDEX.md as the causality record. Preserve this separation to maintain both performance and debuggability.
