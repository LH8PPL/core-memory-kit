When spawning agent pools via batch invocation, args may arrive as either JSON string or parsed object. Guard with `typeof args === 'string' ? JSON.parse(args) : args` to normalize before processing. Use `parallel(map(=> () => agent(...)))` pattern for parallel spawning (documented pattern).

**Why:** Previous launch failed silently at script-eval due to inconsistent input format. Guard prevents eval errors and ensures agents spawn correctly.

**How to apply:** Apply guard in agent launcher whenever args come from external/serialized invocation context.
