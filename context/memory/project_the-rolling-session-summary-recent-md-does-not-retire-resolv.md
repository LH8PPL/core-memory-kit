The rolling session summary (recent.md) does NOT retire RESOLVED threads — a completed multi-day epic leaves a stale 'pending' line in the injected snapshot (e.g. v0.4.0 shipped but recent.md still injected 'Kiro adapter seam: RESEARCH-FIRST, pending'). MEMORY.md auto-capture works; the gap is thread-RESOLUTION not propagating to the rolling summary tier.

**Why:** A stale 'pending' line in the injected context is the cross-session-amnesia failure the kit exists to kill, applied to the kit's own session summaries. The next session reads a resolved epic as still-open.

**How to apply:** When a thread resolves (epic ships, task closes), the rolling-window compression should reconcile/drop the matching Active-Threads line in recent.md, not carry it forward verbatim. Until that's automated, a session that ships a major lane should correct recent.md's Active Threads. v0.x candidate: a 'thread-resolution sweep' in compress-session.
