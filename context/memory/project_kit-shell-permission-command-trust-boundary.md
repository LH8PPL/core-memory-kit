Kit pre-trusts only its own commands (`cmk hook`, `cmk remember`, etc.). Arbitrary shell commands (`python`, `cd`, etc.) require explicit user approval. Memory commands (`cmk remember`) should NOT trigger approval prompts — that is the expected behavior from the D-199 fix.

**Why:** Security boundary: kit commands are internal and trusted; user commands need approval. D-199 eliminated unnecessary prompts for kit's own memory operations.

**How to apply:** When testing, approve non-kit shell commands via "Yes, single permission". Memory commands should pass silently. This split behavior is correct.
