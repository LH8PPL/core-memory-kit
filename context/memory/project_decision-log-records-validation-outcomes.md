DECISION-LOG entries record the concrete outcomes and choices from major validation work. Example: after a field survey, the entry includes the honest X-of-N denominator (how many systems matched the hypothesis) and the decision made based on results. DECISION-LOG complements ADRs: ADRs describe the framework/thesis; DECISION-LOG records actual data and choices.

**Why:** Separating framework (ADR) from outcomes (DECISION-LOG) allows durable decision logic while capturing the real-world validation data.

**How to apply:** After a survey or major validation completes, write a DECISION-LOG entry with the outcome, supporting data, and any implementation implications.
