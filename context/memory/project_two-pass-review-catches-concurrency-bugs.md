Two-pass review (self-review composition pass + skill-review code pass) caught a dangling-promise bug in the original sync-drain (timeout + `process.exit` stranding the buffer). Single-pass self-review had cleared it.

**Why:** Composition-level thinking (logic flow) and code-level thinking (implementation, cleanup, concurrency) catch different bug classes.

**How to apply:** For async/concurrent code, use two passes: first on composition/flow, second on implementation details (cleanup, resource leaks, edge cases).
