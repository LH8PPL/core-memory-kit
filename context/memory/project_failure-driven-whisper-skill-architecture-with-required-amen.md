**Design**: automated whisper (hooks-layer detection) surfaces diagnostic guidance via skill when failures occur.

**Two amendments required before implementation**:
- Self-heal-first scoping: auto-fix what's safe (recovery); whisper only for judgment-call failures (missing CLI, broken registration, reinstall decisions). Aligns with prior Task 248 decision against "doctor performs the fix."
- Noise threshold: only trigger on actionable failures (repeated, or failed-then-fixed pattern), never on transient jitter (e.g., single Haiku timeout). Prevents alert fatigue.

**Principle**: signal (event) = state; cannot nag, cannot go stale. Aligns with kit's event-not-schedule pattern and fail-open posture.

**Why:** Addresses blind spot where task was "all report" without self-healing. Should be consistent with user's prior argument on Task 248. Noise threshold keeps whisper from being a nuisance.

**How to apply:** Grill should validate both amendments into the frame before Task 250 implementation. Implement actionable-failure check (repeated OR failed+fixed) in whisper trigger logic.
