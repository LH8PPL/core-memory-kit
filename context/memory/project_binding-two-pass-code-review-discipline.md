All PRs require two sequential review passes before merge is permitted:
- **Pass 1:** Reviewer identifies findings/blockers, author fixes them
- **Pass 2 (post-fix):** Reviewer validates all findings are addressed and confirms regressions are prevented
- Auto-merge is armed only after both passes complete successfully

**Demonstrated value this session:** The second pass on #191 (judgment files) caught 2 critical blockers:
- corrupt-file crash
- replication-inflation vulnerability (double-resolving expectation inflating `n_episodes`, could fake `corroborated` status)

Both would have shipped silently and violated core feature guarantees without this discipline.

**Why:** Two-pass discipline prevents silent bugs from reaching production. The rhythm slows initial merge velocity but catches critical issues that are far costlier to fix post-release.

**How to apply:** When opening a PR, expect a two-cycle review: first feedback → fixes → second validation → auto-merge. Do not merge before both passes complete. Watch for the auto-merge notification after pass 2 clears.
