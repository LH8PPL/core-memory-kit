Only alert on failures that represent a pattern or require judgment: repeated failures, or sequence of (failed → fixed → potential regression). Never alert on transient single events (e.g., one Haiku timeout).

**Why:** Prevents alert fatigue; aligns with user principle "never warn on non-actionable issues" and kit's fail-open posture.

**How to apply:** Add actionable-failure check before whisper emission: scan for (repeated-failure OR failed-then-fixed) pattern. Single transient events are noise; skip.
