Pack-completeness validator is wired into the prerun gate.
Manual tar check (cut-gate9) is now structural, replacing ad-hoc validation.

**Why:** Documents evolution from manual to structured validation; pattern for future gating work

**How to apply:** Future validators should follow this pattern — move manual checks into structured gates
