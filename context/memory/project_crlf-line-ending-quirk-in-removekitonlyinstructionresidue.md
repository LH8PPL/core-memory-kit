- **Issue**: Function compares `left === kitFrontmatter` where `left` is read file content and may have Windows CRLF (`\r\n`), but `kitFrontmatter` template is normalized to Unix LF (`\n`).
- **Result**: Files with CRLF line endings fail the equality check and survive (not removed).
- **Safety**: Fails in safe direction — keeps user-modified files. No data loss, only possible kit-frontmatter residue on Windows.

**Why:** String equality on line-ending-sensitive content; affects Windows users specifically.

**How to apply:** On Windows, expect possible leftover kit frontmatter after uninstall. If strict cleanup is required, normalize line endings before the comparison.
