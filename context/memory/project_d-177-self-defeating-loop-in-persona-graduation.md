When personas overflow the 1800B cap during promotion, they're evicted to `fragments/` directory. However, `fragments/` isn't injected at cold-open, so personas silently disappear from the next session. Task 151 (v0.4.3) will fix this via recurrence-scoring to replace the form-based confidence gate.

**Why:** Known degradation causing personas to vanish; core problem Task 151 redesign addresses

**How to apply:** When implementing Task 151, ensure the promotion-graduation-injection chain stays intact and graduating personas remain accessible
