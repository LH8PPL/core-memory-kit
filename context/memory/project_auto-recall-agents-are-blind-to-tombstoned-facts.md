When an agent (in-session recall, not a human user) retrieves memories, it never sees tombstoned facts. Deleted facts remain invisible to automatic recall. Recovery of tombstoned facts is always human-initiated.

**Why:** An agent confidently recalling a fact the user explicitly deleted is the worst failure mode a memory product can have. Keeping tombstones invisible to agents enforces the invariant that "forget" is truly permanent from the agent's perspective.

**How to apply:** Ensure any auto-recall mechanism (session-start memory load, in-conversation fact retrieval, agent context-building) filters out tombstoned facts by default. Provide explicit flags (--include-tombstoned) only for human-initiated recovery operations, never for agent use.
