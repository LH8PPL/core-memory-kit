D-386 is a diagnostic record documenting a SonarCloud server-side issue affecting this project. Symptoms: 500/504 errors at project-scoped endpoint (e.g., `?key=LH8PPL_core-memory-kit`); failures correlate with wall-clock, not code changes. Causally unrelated to commits. Status page shows "All Systems Operational," so root cause is either undeclared partial outage or wedged project state on SonarCloud's side.

**Why:** Inherited red CI status looks like a code problem to a future session. Recording D-386 prevents misdiagnosis and false investigation.

**How to apply:** When SonarCloud analysis fails on main, check D-386 first. If error matches (500 at project endpoint, timing-based), it's environmental and known. If different error or endpoint, it may be new code issue.
