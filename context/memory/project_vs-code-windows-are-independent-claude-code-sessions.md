Each VS Code window runs its own independent process with:
- Separate Claude Code session (own conversation history)
- Separate MCP server instance (cmk mcp serve)
- Independent random auth token per activation
- Server bound to 127.0.0.1 on random high port
- Closing/restarting one window does NOT affect other windows

**Why:** Critical for parallel work and troubleshooting; prevents confusion about session/server state; allows independent problem-solving in different windows without risk to other conversations

**How to apply:** Treat each VS Code window as completely isolated; restarting one window (for server refresh, rebuild, etc.) does not impact other Claude Code conversations or windows
