**Previous state:** Task 165(a) parked under D-196, mis-diagnosed as "doc-correct format, unclear why"
**Discovery method:** live testing (user tested kiro_default auto-capture, MCP trust behavior, and memory save — corrected headless assumptions)
**New state:** real root cause found; task promoted to fix lane (v0.4.6, grouped with Task 196 kiro-surface work)
**Done-options:** (a) add `allowedTools: ["@cmk"]` to cmk agent + re-test, (b) accept/document one-click "trust for session" workflow, (c) document split in docs/KIRO.md

**Why:** Upgrade from "diagnose unclear issue" to "fix known problem with multiple remediation paths". Ready to close via one of the three options.

**How to apply:** When implementing MCP auto-approval fixes, reference Task 165(a) v0.4.6 lane; tied to Task 196 kiro-surface work.
