claude-memory-kit releases follow a two-phase validation workflow:
- **Phase 1: Automatable tests** — run multiple test suites (§4: core functionality; §7: extended coverage)
- **Phase 2: Manual in-chat checks** — user review of checks requiring judgment (M0–M3, W1, D-recall, E1 cold-open, R1)

Process: automatable → fix failures → rebuild/re-verify → continue automatable → surface manual checks for user review.

**Why:** Separates repeatable, fast validation from expensive manual review. Unblocks parallel work and provides clear visibility into validation progress.

**How to apply:** Use this two-phase structure for v0.3.3 and future releases. Update test inventories per release. Maintain "automatable first" pattern so user review happens only when needed.
