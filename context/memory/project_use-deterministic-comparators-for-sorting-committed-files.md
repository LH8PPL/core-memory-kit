When sorting committed files (e.g., INDEX.md), use an explicit, deterministic comparator instead of locale-based collation (localeCompare). Locale sorting varies by system, making committed content non-reproducible across machines.

**Why:** Committed files must produce identical sorted output everywhere; locale collation breaks reproducibility

**How to apply:** In Array.sort() operations on committed file data, use an explicit deterministic comparator; avoid localeCompare and default sort
