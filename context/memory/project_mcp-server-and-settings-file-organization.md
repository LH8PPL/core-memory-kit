- `.mcp.json` (project root): Registers project-scoped MCP servers; committed to git, travels with clone
- `.claude/settings.json`: Hooks, permissions, skills (project-scoped, committed)
- `~/.claude.json` (home dir): Local/private MCP servers (user-specific, not committed)

**Why:** Project-scoped tools must travel with `git clone` so all teammates get the same MCP servers, while user-specific customizations remain local

**How to apply:** When setting up project MCP configuration, expect `.mcp.json` at the project root (not in `.claude/`); MCP server permissions go in `.claude/settings.json`
