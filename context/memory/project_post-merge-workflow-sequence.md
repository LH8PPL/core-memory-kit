After PR stress tests pass:
1. Squash-merge the PR
2. Pull main
3. Watch main's CI (by named check, not generic polling)
4. Write build-log retro
5. Start next task on fresh branch

**Why:** Standard post-test deployment workflow; watching by name indicates a specific CI check to monitor before proceeding.

**How to apply:** When PRs pass all checks, follow this sequence; don't just wait for CI—monitor the named check explicitly.
