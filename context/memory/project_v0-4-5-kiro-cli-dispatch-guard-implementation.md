Two changes in v0.4.5:
1. **`kiro-hook-dispatch.mjs`**: added recursion guard `if (env.CMK_BACKEND_SPAWN) return noop`. Activates when kit spawns kiro-cli as LLM backend. In normal user sessions (env var absent), guard is no-op → behavior unchanged from June.
2. **`kiro-hook-command.mjs`**: added `cursorHookCommand()` function (Cursor support; doesn't affect Kiro path).

The dispatch guard is a **real change to the live inject/capture path**. Unit-tested in v0.4.5 (`cli-kiro-hook-dispatch.test.js`), not live-re-tested this cut.

**Why:** Dispatch path changed, so June live-test proof doesn't fully cover v0.4.5 kiro-cli. Exemplifies "unit-green ≠ works-on-real-input" principle the project warns against.

**How to apply:** For current-cut kiro-cli confidence, run Kiro live gate (exercises dispatch with guard in real session). IDE hooks untouched; June IDE proof stands.
