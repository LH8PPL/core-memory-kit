Both `runInstall` and `runUninstall` should honor injected log sinks for test control. This is the consistent pattern used by these paired tools.

**Why:** Allows tests to inject custom logging; maintains behavioral consistency across related tools.

**How to apply:** When modifying uninstall logic, apply the same log-sink-injection behavior already present in runInstall.
