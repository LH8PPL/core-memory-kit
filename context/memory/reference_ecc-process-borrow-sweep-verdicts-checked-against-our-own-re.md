ECC process-borrow sweep verdicts (checked against our own repo, not assumed): REJECTED commitlint - 38/40 recent commits already conform and both outliers use our deliberate research(recall): scope, so a stock conventional-commits linter would flag our OWN convention as an error. REJECTED a TROUBLESHOOTING.md - QUICKSTART.md already carries a Symptom/Cause/Fix table, so a new file is a second surface for one concern (the rogue-doc-surface class validate-doc-registry prevents). REJECTED reusable workflow_call files - the real duplication IS 9 setup-node blocks, which one .nvmrc fixes per line. ACCEPTED only the Node-pin drift (Task 240): bench-storage.yml runs Node 24 while every gate runs 20.

**Why:** Four plausible borrows from a 211k-star project; one survived a five-minute check of our own repo. 'They do X and we don't' is a hypothesis, not a finding - the gap is only real if our side actually lacks it.

**How to apply:** If a future sweep of ECC (or any large adjacent project) re-proposes commitlint, a TROUBLESHOOTING.md, or reusable workflows, these were already evaluated and rejected WITH evidence - see D-367. Re-open only with new evidence, per the decision-log discipline.
