3-phase sequential testing to validate hook installation and firing:
- **Probe 1 (inject+capture)**: Create FastAPI /health endpoint → verify `context\sessions\now.md` grows
- **Probe 2 (delete-guard)**: Request shell folder deletion → verify BLOCKED message appears (PreToolUse block)
- **Probe 3 (observe-edit)**: Create 60-line calc.py → verify file=... line appended to `now.md` (PostToolUse fire)
- Execution: one probe at a time; let turn complete; check disk artifacts before proceeding to next

**Why:** Live validation that cmk install output produces working v1 hooks auto-loaded in Kiro IDE (different from migration-script test)

**How to apply:** Run probes in order; primary validation signal is disk state (now.md growth, BLOCKED message, file= lines); pause between probes to verify
