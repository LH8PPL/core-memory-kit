- Kiro does not provide custom agents with a working tool to execute commands
- This blocks manual save attempts (when the assistant tries to run a command to persist a fact)
- The same limitation exists in the MCP variant
- This is not a kit bug; it's a kiro platform constraint

**Why:** This explains why the manual "remember this" command appears to succeed but doesn't actually persist (the assistant sees a fake ✅ but nothing runs). Future sessions need to know this is by design (platform limit), not a kit defect.

**How to apply:** Document this kiro limitation in the kit's known-issues or setup guide. Don't recommend manual save as a feature in kiro-cli; lean on automatic capture instead. Claude Code and Kiro IDE have working command execution and should continue supporting full manual-save workflow.
