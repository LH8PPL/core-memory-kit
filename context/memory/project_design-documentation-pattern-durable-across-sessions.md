Reframes and rejected design shapes are stored in tasks.md and the fact store for durability. A fresh session picks up the corrected frame rather than rediscovering draft rejections.

**Why:** Prevents rework and preserves reasoning behind shape decisions

**How to apply:** When working on a new lane or PR, check tasks.md and the fact store for prior explorations and rejected alternatives before proposing a new direction
