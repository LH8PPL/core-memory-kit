Shared threat-pattern library with three scoped subsets (all/context/strict), each with false-positive tolerance tuned to its detection boundary. Patterns called from three lifecycle points.

**Why:** Reference pattern for organizing threat detection across multiple boundaries; shows how to reuse patterns with scope-specific tuning

**How to apply:** Consider adopting multi-scope pattern library in the kit's threat/PII detection design to reduce false positives at different lifecycle points
