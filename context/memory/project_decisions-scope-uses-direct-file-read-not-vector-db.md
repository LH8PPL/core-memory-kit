The `decisions` scope in search reads `context/DECISIONS.md` directly as a markdown file, NOT from the indexed vector DB (`vec_observations`, `vec_transcripts`). The journal is a derived markdown view, not a DB table, and is NOT indexed by `cmk reindex`. Therefore, semantic search is impossible for this scope — there is nothing to embed in the vector store.

**Why:** Task 156 established this design to reuse the file-read precedent and maintain the journal as a live markdown view. Semantic search requires indexed data; the journal is neither indexed nor stored as table rows.

**How to apply:** When designing or debugging the decisions scope, remember it is keyword-only by design. Do not attempt to add semantic support — the journal cannot be indexed and embedded. Keyword-scan-the-file is the correct and only mechanism.
