This project uses a structured system to preserve decisions, research, and design history:
- **Decision Log**: Decisions tracked with IDs (e.g., D-173, D-174, D-175)
- **Superseded work**: Marked in DECISION-LOG as "SET ASIDE {date} by {new-decision-id}" with full rationale preserved (never deleted)
- **Research and findings**: Archived in `docs/research/` with INDEX file for retrieval
- **Design docs**: Use section references (e.g., §8.2.5) for precise cross-linking and historical context
- **Rationale always recorded**: Every decision documents *why* — the premise, measurements that falsified it, alternative paths — so future work understands the history and can safely fall back if needed

**Why:** The team frequently revisits decisions (e.g., size-cap design may return if future measurements show different constraints). Recording full context prevents re-deriving analysis and makes fallback decisions safe. Builds institutional memory and supports learning.

**How to apply:** When pivoting: (1) update DECISION-LOG with "SET ASIDE {date} by {decision-id}", (2) record measurements in `docs/research/` with INDEX entry, (3) document the premise, the measurement that falsified it, and the new direction.
