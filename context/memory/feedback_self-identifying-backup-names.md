Backup snapshot folder names must be self-identifying — prefix each snapshot with the full run/backup name, e.g. '12_v0.4.0_kiro_run2-.claude-memory-kit', NOT a generic 'BEFORE-.claude-memory-kit'. So a snapshot tells you which run it came from no matter where it's moved/copied.

**Why:** Generic BEFORE-/AFTER- prefixes lose which gate run they belong to once copied out of the run dir; a run-prefixed name is unambiguous evidence.

**How to apply:** When backing up, name each snapshot <run-name>-<original-dir>, e.g. '12_v0.4.0_kiro_run2-.aws'. Update any restore script that reads BEFORE-* to read the run-prefixed names.
