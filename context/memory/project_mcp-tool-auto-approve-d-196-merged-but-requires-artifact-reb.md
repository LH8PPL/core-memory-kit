- **Status:** D-196 (MCP-tool auto-approve fix) merged to main
- **Current gap:** Live Kiro session has pre-D-196 artifact; config-level auto-approve not active yet
- **Workaround:** User manually trusted MCP tool by clicking "always add it"; approval persists in Kiro settings
- **Resolution path:** Full rebuild from `packages/cli` + reinstall globally to activate D-196 in live session
- **Timing strategy:** Rebuild can be deferred until end of Session 1; tests KH1/KH2/KC/E1 proceed with manual trust

**Why:** D-196 is the 8th cross-agent gate cut-blocker. Live session proved 4 prior fixes work. MCP-tool approval test verifies config-level fix—final piece before shipping. Deferring rebuild keeps Session 1 feedback loop tight.

**How to apply:** When ready to verify M1 final state (auto-approve by config, not manual click), do full rebuild/reinstall. Manual trusts won't interfere with config-level behavior testing.
