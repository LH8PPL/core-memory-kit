D-228 kernel decision establishes design.md as the single canonical architecture mechanism doc. Explicitly forbids spinning up separate `docs/design/` files. Size (429 KB, 3777 lines) is intentional comprehensiveness, not cruft.

**Why:** Prevents architectural fragmentation; maintains unified source of truth.

**How to apply:** When planning doc cleanup or architecture work, preserve design.md as one monolithic doc. Route all design decisions there.
