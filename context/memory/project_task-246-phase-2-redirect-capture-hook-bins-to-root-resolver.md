The actual Task 246 fix involves updating 8 capture-hook bins to point at the root context/memory/ resolver rather than nested paths. This prevents recurrence of the misdirection that necessitated recovery work.

**Why:** Recovery cleaned up misplaced files, but the root cause is that capture logic directs memories to wrong locations. The fix must redirect the 8 hooks.

**How to apply:** This is the code-level fix that completes Task 246, safe to proceed after recovery/cleanup work is confirmed.
