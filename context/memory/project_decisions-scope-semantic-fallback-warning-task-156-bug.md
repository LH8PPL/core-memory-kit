`cmk search --scope decisions` attempts semantic backend first. Semantic correctly rejects it (decisions is keyword-only by design per search.mjs:163). CLI then prints "semantic default unavailable (unknown-scope:decisions) — falling back to keyword" to stderr.

This frames an intentional design choice as a failure and emits to stderr — indistinguishable from the real stale-MCP-server `unknown-scope` error users are warned about.

**Fix:** Short-circuit when `--scope decisions` — skip the semantic attempt entirely and default to keyword **silently** (no warning).

**Why:** Headline feature (Task 156, decisions recall) works but looks broken. Cosmetic defect in flagship feature kills user confidence on first impression.

**How to apply:** In search.mjs or subcommands.mjs, detect `--scope decisions` early and skip semantic backend attempt, defaulting straight to keyword with no output.
