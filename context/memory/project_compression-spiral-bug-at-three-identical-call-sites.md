The timeout/truncation bug affects compress-session, daily-distill, and weekly-curate identically. All three call `backend.compress(input, timeoutMs: 50_000)` with no input bound. Daily-distill reads 7 days of `today-*.md` whole into input. A per-`now.md` fix doesn't solve it — the bug repeats at the daily-distill site.

**Why:** The bug is systemic at three sites, not localized to one verb. Per-verb or per-buffer fixes are incomplete; the root issue is unbound input to backend.compress.

**How to apply:** Fix at the CompressorBackend.compress boundary (or a shared helper the three verbs call before backend.compress) to fix all three from one place.
