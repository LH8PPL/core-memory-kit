CC 2.1.x closed security holes in wildcard auto-approval for MCP tools. Rules like `mcp__cmk__*` no longer auto-approve per-tool prompts; each tool must be explicitly allowed in `settings.json`.

**Why:** CC's upstream security tightening; explains the v0.4.1 regression and why Bug 171 happened

**How to apply:** When testing CMK on CC 2.1.x+, expect individual per-tool prompts unless they are explicitly whitelisted. The kit's settings.json generation must list all 11 tools individually (which v0.4.1 now does).
