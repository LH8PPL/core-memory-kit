**Status:** Merged and live (CI green)
**Scope:** ADR-0022 implementation
- cmk redact: remove secrets from memory facts
- cmk purge --hard: delete facts entirely with cascade verification
**Validation:**
- Live testing caught titled-borne secrets surviving in committed filenames
- Skill review found gaps: L-tier scratchpads (incl. `private.md`), committed `DECISIONS.md` journal, purge audit path echo
- All gaps fixed at root
- Test suite: 30 tests, stress 5/5, zero residuals verified

**Why:** Reference point for completed feature; demonstrates project's multi-layer review + live-test approach catching real edge cases (secrets in filenames).

**How to apply:** When understanding deletion/redaction scope or referring to secret-handling capabilities, cite PR #295 as the authoritative implementation.
