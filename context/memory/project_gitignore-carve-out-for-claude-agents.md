The `.claude/` directory is gitignored (per-developer settings, scaffolding, skills), but `.claude/agents/` is explicitly re-included and committed to preserve agent definitions as project doctrine and version history.

**Why:** Agent definitions are durable, project-wide policy (not per-developer), so they belong in git. Settings and scaffolding remain ignored per original design.

**How to apply:** All agent definitions go in `.claude/agents/` (committed). Other `.claude/` contents stay ignored.
