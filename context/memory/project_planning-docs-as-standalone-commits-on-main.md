Planning documents (tasks.md, RELEASE-PLAN.md, memory syncs) that span a release are committed to main **first, as standalone docs-only commits**, separate from feature/task implementation branches.

**Why:** Maintains "single source of truth, same commit batch" discipline. Scope decisions are visible in main history and don't get tangled with task PR reviews.

**How to apply:** Before branching for individual tasks, commit planning docs to main. Each task branch starts clean from main after planning docs merge.
