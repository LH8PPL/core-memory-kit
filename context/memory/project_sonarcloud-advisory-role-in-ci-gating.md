SonarCloud is **advisory-only** in this project's CI — not a blocking gate. Real gating checks: CI, CodeQL, gitleaks, osv-scanner, npm-audit (all green). SonarCloud red does not block releases. Pre-existing D-39 hotspots-reviewed gate is documented as accepted red (free-tier limitation).

**Why:** v0.5.1 published successfully despite SonarCloud crash. Prevents over-investment in fixing advisory-only tooling and clarifies severity hierarchy.

**How to apply:** When SonarCloud shows red, determine if it's a known issue (D-39, Task 224) or new. Advisory red does not require release delays or critical urgency.
