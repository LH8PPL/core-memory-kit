Development backups stored at `~\` (not temp) with naming pattern `before-cut-gateN-vX.Y.Z-.claude-memory-kit`, where N is the cut-gate number and X.Y.Z is the version. Examples in use: `before-cut-gate17-v0.3.4-.claude-memory-kit`, `before-cut-gate16-v0.3.3-`, `before-cut-gate-0.3.3-`, `before-cut-gate-0.3.2-`

**Why:** Keeps versioned persona snapshots organized and easily findable during cut-gate testing and version comparisons; establishes a durable artifact location outside transient temp directories

**How to apply:** When creating backups during development, use this location and follow the naming pattern; backups can then be reliably found across sessions
