PR-1 (IDE hooks, ✅ complete) covers `cmk install --ide kiro` wiring (MCP, steering, skills, IDE hooks with platform-correct cmd.exe activation). PR-2 (CLI hooks, planned) will cover CLI hook configuration in agent JSON. They are separate PRs because the surfaces differ fundamentally: location (`.kiro/hooks/` vs agents), activation (automatic vs default-agent), and audience (IDE vs CLI users).

**Why:** IDE and CLI integration require different documentation and config models. Separating them maintains clear scope and prevents review confusion. IDE is now production-ready and deployable independently.

**How to apply:** When designing multi-surface tools, structure PRs by surface boundary, not internal component. This split serves as a precedent for IDE vs CLI or similar multi-audience integrations.
