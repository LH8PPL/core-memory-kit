- **Status:** markdownlint, yamllint, codespell NOT run in CI or npm test; Super-Linter not integrated.
- **.markdownlint.json:** Editor config only (disables 14 rules—MD013, MD024, MD033—for deliberate house styles); no CI binary.
- **Actual enforcement:** Functional doc integrity checked by domain-aware validators (wired into npm test):
  - scripts/validate-references.mjs (link resolution)
  - scripts/validate-doc-registry.mjs (index completeness)
- **Rationale:** Generic linters would noise on 597 memory files and conflict with intentional house styles.

**Why:** Documented architectural decision that prevents accidental reintroduction of generic linters. Explains why actionlint + ShellCheck are the right CI additions (they don't touch memory files).

**How to apply:** When evaluating lint tools for CI, reference this to confirm the architectural choice. Precise, domain-aware validators for doc integrity—not generic linters.
