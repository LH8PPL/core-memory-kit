README and CHANGELOG update only when a user-facing capability ships—not when internal primitives or plumbing tasks complete

**Why:** Prevents "lazy-framing-as-docs anti-pattern" of documenting unshipped features as if they're already live

**How to apply:** Hold README/CHANGELOG updates until the relevant user-facing task (e.g., 50.F for `--ide` flag) is complete and shipped
