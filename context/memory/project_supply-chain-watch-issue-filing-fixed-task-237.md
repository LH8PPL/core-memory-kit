The supply-chain watch's issue-filing workflow had output wiring omitted: it wired `shouldAlert` and `scanStatus` to the output but never included `title`, causing crashes on the first real advisory fire. Fixed in Task 237. The fix is on branch; awaiting CI re-run to confirm it now files issues correctly on real findings.

**Why:** This was a unit-green/integration-broken gap (unit tests used pure reporter; the workflow's output wiring was never exercised until a real advisory fired)

**How to apply:** Monitor CI re-run result; if the supply-chain watch issues file correctly, confirm the fix is working
