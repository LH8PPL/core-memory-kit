- **Original problem:** Dead cron blocks roll indefinitely (compounding forever)
- **Root fix:** 167.A cron-liveness heartbeat age-gate prevents this
- **Q4's secondary goal:** Synchronous drain to stop compounding mid-session
- **Reality:** Once 167.A prevents wrong cron-gate suppression, detached heal-next-session is sufficient; compounding no longer occurs

**Why:** 167.A eliminates the *cause* of the original compounding bug (dead cron blocks roll). This makes synchronous drain (insurance against mid-session compounding) redundant.

**How to apply:** Prioritize shipping the cron-fix (167.A, done) as the root solution. Sync-drain was defensive insurance; once root cause is fixed, rely on detached async healing. Use this to guide option A vs. B vs. C.
