Octopoda initially set 0.80 relevance floor for fact retrieval/hint injection; this filtered out 5 of 7 relevant facts. Lowering to 0.45 improved coverage.

**Why:** Threshold tuning in retrieval systems is non-obvious. A seemingly safe (0.80) floor can be too aggressive, suppressing relevant signals. Applies to Task 233 (recall-nudging validation) and hint-injection logic.

**How to apply:** Start conservative (0.45–0.60) and measure coverage against ground truth. Octopoda's experience suggests 0.80 is too high for typical use.
