After opening or pushing a PR, always monitor its CI to completion and report the result — don't open the PR and stop. The user's directive 2026-06-15: "always monitor CI."

**Why:** The user wants CI watched through to green/red as part of the PR workflow, not treated as a fire-and-forget hand-off. Surfaced when I offered to either monitor or pause after opening PR #185.

**How to apply:** After `gh pr create` or any push to a PR branch, poll `gh pr checks <N>` until all checks resolve; surface failures immediately with the failing job, and report the green result when all pass. Applies to every PR, every session.
