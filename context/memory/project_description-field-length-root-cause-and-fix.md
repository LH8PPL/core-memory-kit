The skill's description field was 1,340 characters, which broke the tool entirely. Fix: trim to 1,021 chars, rewrite in third-person, add structural guards (e.g., line breaks, indentation) to preserve YAML parsing. The fix is validated by re-test (skill now fires cleanly).

**Why:** Long descriptions were silently breaking the YAML structure or exceeding token/parsing limits. This was discovered by code inspection (challenge 1: "Did you check the docs?").

**How to apply:** When extending the kit or adding skills, keep descriptions ≤ 1,021 chars and ensure they parse correctly as YAML third-person prose.
