Claude Code reads hook registrations from `.claude/settings.json` only at startup. When `cmk install` wires hooks, the hooks are registered but not activated until Claude Code is restarted. Without restart, auto-extract (Stop-hook) and other kit hooks will not fire during the session.

**Why:** Claude Code loads hook configuration once at startup and does not hot-reload `.claude/settings.json` changes.

**How to apply:** Always restart Claude Code after running `cmk install` (or any cmk command that modifies `.claude/settings.json`) before starting work. This is non-obvious and easy to miss.
