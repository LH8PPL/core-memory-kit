The kit is expanding to support multiple harnesses beyond Claude.

**Shipped:**
- Kiro IDE/CLI (v0.4.0)

**Committed next:**
- Cursor

**Ordered tail (on demand or breadth-first after v0.4.4):**
- Codex
- Antigravity
- gemini-cli
- opencode
- [others]

**Versioning policy:** Patch numbers assigned when each harness ships per cadence. Pickup trigger: first breadth slot after v0.4.4 or real user demand.

**Why:** Multiple harnesses require clear roadmap and versioning to avoid ad-hoc decisions and release-pressure coupling.

**How to apply:** When new harness requests arrive, check roadmap and demand; add to ordered tail if not listed. Assign version numbers only when work is committed.
