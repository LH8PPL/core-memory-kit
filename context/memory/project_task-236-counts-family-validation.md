Task 236 closes v0.6.1 by covering the `counts` family on `validate-docs`, extending validator Task 186 (shipped in v0.6.0). Same file, same mental model. This addresses recurring drift in prose documentation claims (e.g. "12 MCP tools", "41 CLI verbs") that require ~6 manual fixes per release cycle. Task marked as "S" (small/straightforward).

**Why:** Automating count validation prevents silent documentation drift and eliminates recurring manual fix overhead. Good context locality with existing Task 186 implementation.

**How to apply:** When starting Task 236, reference Task 186's validator pattern/approach; sequence this as next work after Task 235 completes.
