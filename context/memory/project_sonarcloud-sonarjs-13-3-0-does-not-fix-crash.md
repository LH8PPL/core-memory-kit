SonarJS 13.3.0 shipped today. Verified that it does NOT fix the opendir `C:/proj/context` crash — identical gRPC stack signature persists across versions.

**Why:** Eliminates hypothesis that this is a known SonarJS bug; points to environmental/feature root cause instead

**How to apply:** Don't wait for upstream SonarJS fixes; focus investigation on SonarCloud features or project configuration
