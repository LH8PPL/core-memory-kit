Changes to `context/DECISIONS.md` made during development ("dogfood") are not committed with the main feature PR. Instead, they're committed separately in a "post-merge memory-flush commit" following the task-boundary rule.

**Why:** Separates code/feature changes from self-referential metadata

**How to apply:** Leave DECISIONS.md uncommitted during feature PR development. After merge, commit it in a dedicated memory-flush commit.
