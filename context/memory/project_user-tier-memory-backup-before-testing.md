User-tier memory for `cmk` lives in `~\.claude-memory-kit`. Before running version-test probes (via `cut-gate.md`), back it up to prevent test writes from corrupting real work. Backup workflow:
```powershell
$stamp = Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd_HH-mm-ss"
Move-Item $env:USERPROFILE\.claude-memory-kit "C:\cut-gate-backups\user-tier_$stamp"
```
Run tests. Restore afterward with `Move-Item` back.

**Why:** Test probes write to user memory; without backup, real memory state can be overwritten or corrupted during testing.

**How to apply:** Adopt as a standing pre-test step for any new `cmk` version test. The command is reusable; modify the backup destination path if needed.
