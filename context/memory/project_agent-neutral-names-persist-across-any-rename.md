The CLI binary `cmk` and environment variable `MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR` are intentionally agent-neutral (per ADR-0012 §75) and must NOT change in any rename, even to `core-memory-kit`.

**Why:** These are shared infrastructure for multiple agents (Claude, Cursor, Codex). Changing them breaks cross-agent portability.

**How to apply:** In any find-replace for a rename, explicitly carve out `cmk` and `MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR`. They stay as-is.
