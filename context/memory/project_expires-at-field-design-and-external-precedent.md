- **Location**: Defined in design.md §4, never implemented
- **External precedent**: mem0 (TTL on memories), MemPalace/Zep (validity windows), internal consolidator (14-day staleness drop)
- **Direction**: Convergent support; mechanism (sweep) is trivial; gap is *population*

**Why:** Expiry/TTL is well-validated across tools; the risk isn't the idea but whether it gets populated. This context justifies 66.3's population-focused design.

**How to apply:** Use as background for 66.3 justification; focus entirely on *how to populate* the field (auto-extract, explicit flag, real workflow validation).
