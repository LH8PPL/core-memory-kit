- **What**: Walk every named trigger (~39 total), ask "has this condition become TRUE?"
  - If fired: Lane the work OR re-verdict it explicitly (fired triggers cannot remain silently deferred)
  - If not fired: Keep trigger, refresh stale condition text
- **When**: Start of D-248 minor-cut sweep; mirrors as ★ pre-tag step in cut-gate.md
- **Documented in**: CLAUDE.md (D-248 step 3), cut-gate.md, D-267

**Why:** Enforces forcing function to actively monitor triggers. Prevents "lane everything" pattern (rejects fabricated commitments on conditional work; Cursor-slot precedent shows lanes slip). Enforces healthy lifecycle: trigger fires → then lane.

**How to apply:** v0.5.0 cut is first real exercise (check ~39 triggers' firing conditions); repeat for every subsequent minor cut.
