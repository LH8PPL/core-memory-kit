Passive outcome signals identified from memclaw:
- Contradiction
- Supersession
- Repeat-recall
- Terminal-classification
- Cross-session-reuse
- Git-CI

Current capability: we already produce 3 of these 6. This unblocks Tasks 177 (train-the-doc) and 97 (dynamic trust), which were stuck waiting for a success/failure signal without violating D-169 (no explicit user prompts).

**Why:** Breaks a design blocker long-standing blocker. Passive signals are reachable without changing the core constraint.

**How to apply:** When designing signal-dependent features, check this list first. Prioritize signals we already produce; build new ones only if necessary.
