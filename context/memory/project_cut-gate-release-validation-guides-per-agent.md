- cut-gate.md (Claude agent checklist)
- cut-gate-cursor.md (Cursor agent, structurally parallel to cut-gate.md)
- cut-gate-kiro.md (Kiro agent, structurally parallel to cut-gate.md)
- cut-gate-kiro-cli.md (existing; deliberate split for terminal CLI vs IDE)

Three main guides must be structurally identical with agent-specific commands and paths. Keep CLI variant separate.

**Why:** Pre-release validation must verify each agent installs and runs correctly. Structural parity allows reviewers to spot gaps systematically.

**How to apply:** Create cut-gate-cursor.md and cut-gate-kiro.md using cut-gate.md as template; adapt all commands/paths per agent. Preserve cut-gate-kiro-cli.md as terminal-specific variant.
