Task 194 (and v0.5.1) is approved only after live-session signal validation. Criteria: run v0.5.0 on this repo, accumulate real correction events in `trust-signals.log`, verify deltas are sensible (no false-positives, no storms), then proceed.

**Why:** Empirical validation is more trustworthy than review consensus. A misfiring judge detector needs a baseline period to surface. Real-world behavior is the primary evidence.

**How to apply:** Treat `trust-signals.log` inspection as the gate artifact. Defer 194 until signal data is reviewed and shows quality.
