When monitoring CI health, explicitly watch the ci.yml workflow status—not proxy signals like a passing CodeQL report. The rule is now in CLAUDE.md.

**Why:** Incident D-310: watching latched onto a green CodeQL run while ci.yml was red, so main appeared green while actually broken.

**How to apply:** Always check ci.yml state directly, not proxy indicators. This prevents false confidence about CI health.
