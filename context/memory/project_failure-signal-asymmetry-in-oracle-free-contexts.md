Failure detection is reliable (user corrections, re-asks, test failures, `cmk forget`). Success detection is silent — good recalls leave no trace. In kit's session-host context: **prune-on-failure is honest; reinforce-on-success is nearly impossible**.

**Why:** Architectural constraint that defines what success metric the kit can truthfully claim.

**How to apply:** Design memory-update policies to exploit asymmetry — bias toward pruning weak memories over reinforcing strong ones.
