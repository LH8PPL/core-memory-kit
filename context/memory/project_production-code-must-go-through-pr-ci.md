All production code changes (including edits to production source files like `install.mjs`) must go through the PR/branch/CI cycle. Direct-to-main is reserved exclusively for docs, scaffold, and meta materials (housekeeping, configuration). The `.gitattributes` commit this session violated this — it touched production code but bypassed the PR gate.

**Why:** PR/CI ensures code review, confirmed-green test suite before merge, and cross-platform CI validation. CI matrix catches Windows/macOS issues that local runs may miss.

**How to apply:** When shipping, create a branch → PR → CI for all production code. Reserve direct-to-main only for non-code materials (READMEs, config, housekeeping notes).
