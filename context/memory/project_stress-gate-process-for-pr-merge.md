Before opening a PR, run the full test suite 5 times in succession. All 5 runs must pass to merge. Any failure requires investigation per the no-disclaimed-flakes rule; do not merge without root-causing the failure.

**Why:** Catches intermittent/flaky test failures before they enter main branch; prevents false-passing PRs from degrading branch reliability.

**How to apply:** When preparing to open/merge a PR, run the full suite 5×. Monitor all runs. Only proceed if all 5 pass. If any fail, investigate the root cause before merging.
