- Status: v0.3.3 merged, CI green, ready for tag/publish.
- Test plan: Enhanced cut-gate.md with new parts to comprehensively test all kit functions.
- CLI setup: npm pack v0.3.3 tarball → uninstall global → reinstall → `cmk install --with-semantic` in `C:\Temp\cut-gate16`.
- Current state: All setup checks passed, no harm to kit. Backup at `~/.claude-memory-kit/before-cut-gate16-v0.3.3`.
- Next phase: in-chat half (user's part) in fresh Claude Code window on cut-gate16.

**Why:** Clear record of final validation state before release.

**How to apply:** Resume cut-gate testing; kit is in good state, no need to repeat CLI checks.
