**Headline artifacts (Layer 1):** 5 docs — SYSTEM-MAP.md, ADR-0017, U-Mem research note, failure-survey, comparative-judgment note

**Spine updates (Layer 2):** 11 modified files including Tasks 188+189 (new), enrichments to Tasks 55/66/95, D-251 decision-log entry, SOURCES.md, DOCUMENTATION-MAP, context/queues/review.md

**Kit self-capture (Layer 3):** 75 auto-extracted facts from the session that redefined the kit (the dogfood layer)

**At-risk raw evidence:** 4 large temp files (~420 KB total) — comparative-judgment study 152KB, full-field survey 134KB, wave-2 deep-reads 69KB, original 9-system 68KB. Each contains verbatim code quotes, exact file:line references, per-system analyses. Re-generation cost ~4M tokens.

**Why:** The arc produced a thesis (recurrence as the fuel variable) and created multiple output layers. A future session asking "what exists from this arc" needs the complete picture, including what's at-risk. The design principle (evidence-linked claims, decision-trail preservation) makes raw-evidence preservation a design choice, not an afterthought.

**How to apply:** Before disposition decisions (e.g., let raw evidence expire, or commit it), consult this inventory. If committing raw files, register as `docs/research/raw/{date}-{artifact}/` frozen archives with citations in synthesis notes. If discarding, document as a design boundary (synthesis-only).
