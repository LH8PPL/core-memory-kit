"`cmk pack` reads the committed tree (e.g., committed package.json), not the working directory. Version in tarball is determined by what was committed at the release step. Example: release commit 209e2aa commits package.json with `0.4.4`, so the tarball reports 0.4.4. Use `cmk --version` after install to verify."

**Why:** Build tool reads committed state, not uncommitted changes. Non-obvious and can cause version mismatches if release commit has not yet reached main.

**How to apply:** Ensure version bump is part of the release commit. Verify with `cmk --version` after installing the packed tarball. If mismatch, verify release commit is on main branch.
