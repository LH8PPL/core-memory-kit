- Automatic fixes live in `cmk install`/upgrade flow, not in commands users run
- On upgrade: kit auto-detects stray `context/` tiers and recovers their facts into root
- `cmk doctor` is secondary backstop only — reports issues, never the primary fix pathway
- Core principle: users should never need to run commands to fix themselves

**Why:** Aligns with kit philosophy (D-85/D-164/D-169) that the kit self-heals automatically; invisible-until-you-run-a-command fixes are design failures

**How to apply:** For future recovery/cleanup/migration features, build into install/upgrade first; doctor/validation tools are secondary safety nets only
