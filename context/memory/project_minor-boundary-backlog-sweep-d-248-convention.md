- **When**: Runs as part of every minor version release (e.g., v0.5.X cut)
- **Process**: Scan backlog for triggered items
- **Lane rule**: Triggered items → NEXT version; nothing is re-killed or merged into current release
- **Outcome**: Keeps releases clean, queue predictable, no strays or backlog creep

**Why:** Deliberate governance to prevent lost work and accidental scope creep.

**How to apply:** Expect D-248 as a standard release-commit step. When starting v0.5.4+, check what came from the prior sweep and prioritize those lanes first.
