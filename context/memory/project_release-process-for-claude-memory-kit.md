The release workflow:
- `npm run release -- patch` — bumps version, updates CHANGELOG [Unreleased] → [X.Y.Z], commits
- Review the diff and commit if needed
- `git push origin vX.Y.Z` — pushes the tag, triggering publish.yml
- publish.yml: runs CI suite, publishes to npm with provenance, creates GitHub Release

**Why:** Ensures consistent, repeatable release process with automated publishing via GitHub Actions.

**How to apply:** When ready to release, run npm release command, review the diff, then git push the tag. The rest is automated. Verify the publish.yml workflow completes before marking release as live.
