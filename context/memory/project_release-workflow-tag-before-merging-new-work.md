This project's release process requires pushing the version tag at the release commit BEFORE merging any new work. If commits are merged between the release commit and the tag push, they will be swept into the wrong version when the tag is pushed, contaminating the release.

**Why:** Ensures CHANGELOG version claims match the actual tagged commits—maintaining release integrity.

**How to apply:** For each release: (1) verify release commit is on main, (2) push tag at that commit, (3) then open the next lane and merge new work. Never merge between release commit and tag push.
