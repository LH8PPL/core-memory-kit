- **Post-retrieval filtering:** Re-score all retrieved candidates against the *immediate task context* before injection; drop low-scoring docs. "Significantly improves output quality" vs retrieve-and-inject-all pattern.
- **Query expansion (HyDE):** Generate a hypothetical answer to the user query, embed that synthetic text, and search with it — bridges paraphrase gap between how users ask and how facts are stored.
- Both are missing from current recall pipeline; both are actionable for Task 178 (recall quality) and Task 149 (when-to-recall judgment).

**Why:** The ML Mastery articles on context-aware search and effective context engineering document real techniques that directly address the paraphrase-recall problem (Task 65/99 already measures this gap).

**How to apply:** Task 178: Add post-filter layer + HyDE variant to benchmark. Task 149: Consider HyDE as a retrieval-quality lever for judgment-pulled recall.
