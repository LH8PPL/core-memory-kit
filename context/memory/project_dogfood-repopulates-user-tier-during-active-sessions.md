The auto-extract/persona pipeline writes to the user tier continuously while working on this repo. Even after backing up the tier, continued session activity will repopulate it via dogfood.

Gate implication: B3/B4/B8 persona-fill checks behave differently against a pre-populated tier (trivial pass) vs a truly empty one (true capture-from-zero validation).

**Why:** The gate assumes persona capture from zero. Active dogfood in the working directory breaks that assumption, potentially masking persona-pipeline failures.

**How to apply:** To run an honest cut gate: back up the user tier again immediately before the gate's Session 1, or run the gate in an isolated directory (not this repo) to prevent dogfood repopulation.
