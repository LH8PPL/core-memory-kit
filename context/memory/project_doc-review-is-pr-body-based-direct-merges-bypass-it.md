Doc review happens in the PR body during code review. Direct merges bypass this gate entirely. Task 174 merged directly, causing three doc gaps to slip (README, checkbox, changelog section). The PR workflow is the enforcement mechanism for doc updates.

**Why:** Assistant identified direct merge as the root cause of stale docs despite binding rules.

**How to apply:** Enforce PR-based merges to protect doc review, or add a separate doc-review step for direct merges.
