- PowerShell's `Get-Content` displays UTF-8 special characters (middots U+00B7, em-dashes) as mojibake (`ֲ·`, `ג€"`) on standard console
- File bytes are actually correct UTF-8 (verified via `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText` or hex dump)
- Makes clean scaffolds *look* corrupted during G4 gate checks, causing false-positive validation failures in future setup runs
- **Workaround:** Read with `[System.IO.File]::ReadAllText` or set `[Console]::OutputEncoding = [System.Text.UTF8Encoding]::UTF8` before validation

**Why:** Prevents future cmk setup runs from falsely failing gate checks due to display artifacts masking correct file state on Windows

**How to apply:** Update cmk's cut-gate.md G4 read-command guidance to use UTF8-safe read method; document that standard Get-Content mojibake does not indicate file corruption
