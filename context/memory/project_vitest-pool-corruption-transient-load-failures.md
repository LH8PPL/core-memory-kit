Vitest can experience transient pool corruption that causes all test suites to fail to load (displaying 0 actual test failures). Fresh `npm test` re-runs clear the corruption automatically (verified 5/5 re-runs in this session).

**Why:** Distinguishes transient vitest infrastructure issues from real code failures; prevents false-alarm debugging when all loads fail but no actual tests fail.

**How to apply:** If many test suites fail to load with 0 actual failures, re-run before investigating code. Do not treat load failures as a code problem without a second run.
