Vitest workers spawned from the Claude Code Bash tool inside VS Code can fail universally with 'TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading config)' — the Git Bash shell inherits VS Code extension-host env (ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1, VSCODE_ESM_ENTRYPOINT) which poisons node child processes. The identical npm test passes from PowerShell. Diagnosed 2026-07-22 during Task 233 (npm ci did NOT fix it; shell isolation did).

**Why:** Prevents a future session from re-diagnosing a full-suite red as a code problem when it is shell-env poisoning

**How to apply:** Run npm test from PowerShell (or strip ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE/VSCODE_* vars) when every vitest test fails with the config TypeError
