Workspace-level facts (tier 'P') captured via memory-write skill can be promoted to cross-project scope via `cmk lessons promote <id>` or the mk_lessons_promote tool.

Target: LESSONS.md section "Cross-Project Lessons" for standing rules.

**Why:** Allows validated workspace facts to surface as standing rules across all future projects.

**How to apply:** After memory-write captures a workspace fact, promote it via mk_lessons_promote if it applies to all projects (e.g., "always use uv not pip").
