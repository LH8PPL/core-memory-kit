- ✅ Kit-only husks removed cleanly: 0 .kiro/ files, no AGENTS.md, no ~/.aws agent
- ✅ User content preserved intact (even when bordered by ---)
- ✅ context/ directory never touched

**Why:** Answers the open question "does uninstall actually work?" with live-verified results; D-191/B1 was a real data-loss risk

**How to apply:** Cite these results when documenting or troubleshooting uninstall behavior; confidence level is now high
