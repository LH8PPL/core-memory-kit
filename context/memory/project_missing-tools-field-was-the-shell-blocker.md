The agent config was missing `tools: ['*']`, which prevented the shell tool from being available to the agent during `cmk remember` / `cmk search` execution. Adding this single field unblocked memory persistence. This was the "cut-blocker" that had been preventing prior attempts to eliminate the `--project` machinery.

**Why:** Understanding the root cause prevents regression and explains why prior refactors stalled. The fix is minimal and isolated.

**How to apply:** When next working on agent integration, verify `tools: ['*']` is present in the agent shell config. If shell execution fails silently in future versions, check this field first.
