Matcher fix (D-197) did not resolve the bug. Guard bin works in isolation but kiro-cli still deletes. Two hypotheses:
- **H1:** Matcher format — kiro-cli 2.8.1 requires literal hook name (e.g., `'execute_bash'`), not wildcard `'*'`.
- **H2 (most likely):** Payload mechanism — kiro-cli 2.8.1 passes hook payloads via `_HOOK_EVENT` env var, not stdin. Guard bin reads empty stdin → fail-open.

Diagnostic: instrument the gate's preToolUse hook to log stdin + environment, run a delete in kiro-cli, analyze output.

**Why:** Root cause unknown; hypothesis-driven diagnosis settles the issue in one test cycle vs. continued guessing.

**How to apply:** After user approval, wire diagnostic probe as preToolUse hook, user runs one delete in kiro-cli, output determines fix path.
