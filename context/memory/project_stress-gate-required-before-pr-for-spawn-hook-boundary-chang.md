When changes touch spawn/hook boundaries, the stress-gate (5/5 test suite) must complete and pass before pushing or opening a PR. This is a blocking requirement, not optional.

**Why:** Spawn/hook boundary changes require empirical gate verification before PR submission

**How to apply:** For work touching spawn/hook code: complete full test suite (2823/2823) → await stress-gate (5/5) completion → push/open PR
