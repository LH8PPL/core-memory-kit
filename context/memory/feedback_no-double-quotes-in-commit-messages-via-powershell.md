PowerShell 5.1 silently mangles git commit messages containing embedded double quotes — even inside single-quoted here-strings. The commit fails with pathspec errors, and in a chained command the failure can scroll past unnoticed (it happened twice on 2026-06-12; the second time the suite output buried it).

**Why:** PS 5.1 native-argument re-quoting splits the message at embedded double quotes regardless of here-string quoting; git then parses the fragments as pathspecs.

**How to apply:** Write commit messages without any double-quote characters (rephrase: adding-new-HCs not "adding new HCs"), or commit via the Bash tool instead. Always check the commit actually landed when chaining (git log -1 or the [branch sha] line).
