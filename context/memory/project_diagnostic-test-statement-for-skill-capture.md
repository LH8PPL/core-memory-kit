Before running full Session 1, execute a single-rule diagnostic test:
- **Test input:** "always run ruff before committing"
- **Action:** Type in Claude Code chat, then click "Yes, allow for this project" when skill prompt appears
- **Scope:** Single rule only; NOT the full multi-rule Session 1 (which includes FastAPI build)

**Why:** Isolates skill-permission behavior from other Session 1 elements. Prevents test contamination: if prompt-free capture works for one rule, full Session 1 can proceed cleanly.

**How to apply:** Execute in folder `cut-gate-v041d`. Inspect settings.json snapshots before/after allowing. If clean, fix kit and run full Session 1 next.
