The release workflow for claude-memory-kit requires cut-gate guide verification BEFORE pushing a release tag. Flow:
1. Fix global cmk installation (close MCP-hosting sessions → clean reinstall → doctor)
2. Run full cut-gate guide on new version (sessions 1–3 + cold-open, including kiro/cursor environments)
3. Tag only after guide passes

v0.5.0 was declared "ready" without this step; tag is now on hold until verification completes.

**Why:** User caught the skip and it matters: this discipline found six blockers this session. Releasing without verification risks broken code reaching users.

**How to apply:** For v0.5.0 and all future releases, do not tag until cut-gate passes. The cut-gate run for v0.5.0 will also live-prove Phase 1 evidence for issue 194.
