- Precondition: stress test passes (5/5)
- Then:
  1. Open PR 245
  2. Run CI enumeration
  3. Merge PR 245
  4. File D-nnn citation-gap task
  5. Decide PR 246 stranded-fact recovery approach
  6. Cut release

**Why:** Sequences the final release steps; structure may apply as a template to future releases

**How to apply:** After stress test completes, follow this checklist in order; use as a release tail template
