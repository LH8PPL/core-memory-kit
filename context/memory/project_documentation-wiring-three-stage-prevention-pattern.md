Close documentation rot with three structural stages:
- **Findable**: document in a registry (e.g., D-249 doc-drift walk)
- **Routed**: developer routed at session start (e.g., CLAUDE.md "Read these in order")
- **Kept-Alive**: update mandate per-change (must update or declare N/A)

**Why:** Prevents silent rot; makes doc debt visible structurally, not via memory

**How to apply:** New system docs need all three: registry entry, session routing directive, update-guard
