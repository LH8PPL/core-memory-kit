`validate-docs` currently verifies ADR/FR/NFR/Task/§ references but NOT `D-nnn` decision-log IDs. This session surfaced drift: D-382 cited before it existed; D-386/387/388 written in sequence without validation. A task to add D-nnn ID checking to the validator is being filed this turn.

**Why:** The validation gap allowed decision-log ID drift to go unnoticed; closing it prevents future drift

**How to apply:** When the D-nnn validator task is assigned, use this as the acceptance criteria; require all D-nnn citations to be validated against their creation date
