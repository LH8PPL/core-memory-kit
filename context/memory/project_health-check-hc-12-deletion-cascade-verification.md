Currently in cmk doctor; verifies that facts marked for deletion are actually purged from SQLite index and all memory files (recent.md, archive.md, today-*.md). Known limitation: fails to name surviving file + fact id when cascade is incomplete; marks as "vacuously clean" when no facts have ever been forgotten.

**Why:** Part of the deletion-propagation guarantee (Task 210); HC-12 is the user-facing health check that certifies cleanup worked.

**How to apply:** When discussing deletion verification or the cmk doctor suite, reference HC-12 by number; know it needs naming improvement for incomplete cascades.
