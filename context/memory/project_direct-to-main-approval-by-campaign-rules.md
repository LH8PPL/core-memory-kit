Direct-to-main commits allowed only for docs/scaffold follow-ups per campaign rules. Production code changes (e.g., install.mjs) must go through PR/CI cycle (branch → PR → CI → merge), even for fixes that seem localized.

**Why:** Enforces code quality gates and test verification. Committing production code directly to main breaks CI discipline and prevents the full test run from catching integration issues. Also: never commit when test failures are present.

**How to apply:** When committing production code, open a branch, file a PR, wait for CI, then merge. Reserve direct-to-main only for documentation, scaffolding, or non-code files per campaign rules.
