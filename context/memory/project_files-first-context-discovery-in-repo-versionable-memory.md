Architectural differentiator: context via regular files (committed in-repo at `.claude/`, `.cursor/`, etc., versionable, traveling with `git clone`) that the agent can search and read — rather than proprietary agent-specific memory stores.

**Independent validation:** Cursor's own dynamic context discovery feature (2026 blog post) independently arrived at the same principle: "context management is files the agent can search," not proprietary memory.

**Why:** Portability across agent versions/integrations. Auditability (memory in git history). Durability (survives agent crashes, switching). Differs from MCP-only or native-memory approaches.

**How to apply:** In-repo `.claude/` and `.cursor/` directories store the portable memory layer. Prefer file-based context APIs over agent-native memory stores. Validates approach as agent-agnostic.
