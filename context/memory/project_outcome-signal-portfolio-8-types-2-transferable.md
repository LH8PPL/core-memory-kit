- **Strong + not-failure-only:** Tool-result/exit-code after recall; `/goal` acceptance-criteria pass/fail
- **Strong + failure-only:** User correction; `cmk forget`
- **Moderate:** Recalled-but-re-searched; Fact-injected-but-used; Contradiction between facts
- **Weak (trap):** Recurrence/re-statement of rule (Task 181 catch — friction, not reinforcement)

The two strong + non-failure signals both exist in Claude Code today and are **unconnected to memory**.

**Why:** Identifies the implementable wins and the deceptive signals to avoid.

**How to apply:** Prioritize wiring tool-result and `/goal` signals into retrieval ranking; flag recurrence as observational noise, not learning.
