When Kiro hooks are updated or repacked (e.g., v0.5.0 binary with fixes), a full restart (close + reopen the IDE) is required to load the new hooks. A reload is insufficient and will retain stale hooks from memory.

**Why:** Kiro caches hooks in memory at startup. Reload does not refresh the cache; old hooks remain active until IDE restart.

**How to apply:** After updating Kiro's binary or hooks, always close and reopen the IDE before running builds/tests. Reload is not adequate.
