Test executed via test-install-refresh.mjs:
1. Scaffolded a skill with known name/marker
2. Staleified it (renamed 2 refs, injected marker string, simulated stale state)
3. Ran `cmk install` (update-in-place scenario)
4. Observed result: old-name refs count = 2 (unchanged), stale marker still present
5. **Conclusion: `cmk install` left stale file completely untouched**

**Why:** Upgrades the finding from "I read install.mjs line 214" to empirical ground truth. Provides concrete evidence for D-343 and justifies the need for `cmk repair --skills` or doctor-tool enhancement.

**How to apply:** Keep the test file and result as reference when implementing skill refresh/repair. The staleify–reinstall–observe pattern is reusable for validating any future fix.
