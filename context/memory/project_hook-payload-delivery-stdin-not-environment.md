Kiro hook payloads arrive on stdin as JSON, not `_HOOK_EVENT` environment variable. Payload includes `hook_event_name`, `cwd`, `session_id`. Original bin design (reading stdin) was correct.

**Why:** Clarifies payload delivery mechanism; guides how to capture/parse hooks in probes or guards

**How to apply:** When capturing hooks in probes/guards, read stdin for JSON. Use probe logs (`kg-probe.log`) to verify hook firing.
