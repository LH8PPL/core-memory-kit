- Merge PR to main
- Watch CI green on main
- Build real tarball from main branch
- Run cold-open test: install from the tarball in a fresh environment
- Only after cold-open passes: tag + publish

**Why:** Catches bugs that pass CI in dev repo but fail in real installs (learned from a prior release incident)

**How to apply:** Before tagging any release, rebuild from main and test the actual artifact in isolation
