When embedding models change, mark facts stale rather than immediately recomputing.
- Affected facts flagged in migration; embeddings left as-is
- Re-embedding happens on-demand during next retrieval for those facts

**Why:** Deferral scales to large deployments; feasible once transcript chunks reach thousands

**How to apply:** Add stale-flag system; during search, detect and re-embed on-demand
