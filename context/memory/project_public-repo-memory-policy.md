this PUBLIC repo commits curated memory tiers only

**Why:** transcripts and session logs carry raw dev-conversation content (name-privacy class), so they stay machine-local here; a normal private project commits them (D-108 deviation)

**How to apply:** committed: context/MEMORY.md, SOUL.md, context/memory/ facts; gitignored: context/transcripts/, context/sessions/ — lines live OUTSIDE the kit's managed gitignore block so reinstalls keep them
