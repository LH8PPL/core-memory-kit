Octopoda's loop-detection engine research is input to:
  - Task 250: Whisper's "actionable failure" detection phase (where loop signals plug in)
  - Task 212: Process-health metrics
Signals under evaluation: Octopoda's five signals, and whether they can run over existing sources (audit.log, extract.log, recall log) without adopting Octopoda's runtime.

**Why:** Loop detection is a required ingredient for the whisper's failure detection and process health monitoring

**How to apply:** After research is complete and registered in SOURCES, Task 250 can proceed with the findings
