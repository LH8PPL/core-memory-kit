ECC's gate hand-enumerates 40 doc locations for staleness checks; gate runs green despite at least one location 4 months stale. Evidence: enumeration is wrong shape (staleness occurs in the 41st unlisted place).
- Generic scan catches staleness anywhere; enumerated checks have dead spots.
- Applied to Task 236: counts family gates use generic scan, not enumeration.

**Why:** Prior-art triage finding that directly motivated architecture choice for Task 236.

**How to apply:** For gate design, prefer generic scans over enumerated lists. Enum-based gates have known failure mode.
