Global install via `npm install -g @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit` may fail with EBUSY if Claude Code's MCP servers are running.

**Before install:** Close Claude Code fully; verify MCP process count is 0 (via Task Manager or `cmk doctor`).

**If EBUSY occurs:** Kill Claude Code and retry the install.

**Why:** Claude Code's MCP processes hold file locks; npm needs exclusive DLL access during installation. DLL contention occurs on Windows.

**How to apply:** Add to pre-install checklist: close Claude Code → confirm 0 MCP processes → run global install → reopen Claude Code.
