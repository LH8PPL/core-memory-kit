When preparing a multi-part feature task, flush accumulated memory to main *before* creating the feature branch. This keeps the feature branch code-only and prevents memory updates from cluttering the PR diff.

**Why:** Feature PRs should reflect code changes only; memory updates are orthogonal and complicate review clarity. Separating them improves PR signal-to-noise.

**How to apply:** End prep work (scouting, planning, documenting findings), push memory to main. Then create the feature branch. During implementation, any interim findings are recorded post-session or committed after PR merge, not during the branch.
