The release workflow includes a tarball-based distribution:
- The installed tarball is a point-in-time snapshot of the built tool
- After merging fixes/changes to main, the tarball does NOT auto-update
- Step 0b must be run after a main merge: repack the tool from updated main and reinstall locally
- Example: after D-263 fix merges, must repack and reinstall before resuming downstream gates (Session 2)

**Why:** Without re-packing, the installed tool carries stale code and does not include newly-merged fixes

**How to apply:** After any main merge that affects downstream work, run step 0b to repack and reinstall before proceeding
