A haiku_timeout occurred on the weekly compression step (07:18:37Z) — an instance of the Task 161 timeout class. This timeout predates the v0.3.4 re-install. v0.3.4 introduced automatic retry logic for compression timeouts, which is now active in this installation.

**Why:** Large compressions can timeout; v0.3.4 added retry recovery. The unretried timeout in this session predates the fix. With new install, future timeouts should auto-retry.

**How to apply:** Monitor the next weekly distill cycle (~7 days) to confirm timeout is retried successfully. If recurs, investigate compression payload size or model capacity. No immediate action — the fix is already deployed.
