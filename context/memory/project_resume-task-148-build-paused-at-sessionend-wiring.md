RESUME POINT for Task 148 (auto-judged privacy, v0.5.0 tag-blocker) — paused 2026-07-08 mid-build on branch task-148-auto-judged-privacy. COMMITTED so far: 0a11a35 (docs foundation: research note + ADR-0019 + design §6.10 + tasks.md done-criteria + D-294; plus 148.1 pii-patterns.mjs 13/13), 63c146a (148.6 redactions-log 5/5 + 148.2a L1 wired into memoryWrite+writeFact, 104/104), b6971ed (WIP: 148.3/148.4 transcript-screen.mjs live-buffer→judge→promote with cold-open-replay test 7/7; capture-turn+capture-prompt L1+live-buffer wiring, capture suites adapted 73/73; transcript-index excludes *.live.md; promote wired into cmk-auto-extract bin + plugin twin + session-end-tasks concurrent block). NEXT (in order): (1) session-end-tasks: promoteOutcome is destructured but NOT yet returned/reported in the summary lines — finish + run its suite; (2) full-suite run (never run since the SessionEnd edit); (3) 148.5 fact-path sensitivity axis (auto-extract classifier emits SENSITIVITY: commit|local-only|drop; local-only → context.local/private.md; drop → skipped_reason sensitivity_drop); (4) 148.7 scaffold .gitignore.fragment gains *.live.md lines + validate-template asserts + privacy.screen kill-switch already built (resolvePrivacyScreen); (5) 148.8 budget-pairs/composition validator entries (PII_JUDGE_TIMEOUT_MS 20s inside child 25s budget) + docs walk (CHANGELOG, README capability line, memory-lifecycle-map, glossary, SYSTEM-MAP edge); (6) two-pass review (self + code-review-excellence via Skill tool, sonnet for agents), stress 5/5, PR, merge; (7) re-gate the cold-open + USER tags v0.5.0. Checkbox state in tasks.md: 148.1+148.6 flipped [x]; 148.2/3/4 built but boxes not yet flipped (flip when the full suite is green). Design refs: ADR-0019, design §6.10, research note 2026-07-07-auto-judged-privacy-prior-art.md.

**Why:** The user paused the session mid-build. Three commits are on the branch; the next session must pick up at the promoteOutcome reporting + full-suite run without re-deriving the plan.

**How to apply:** Resume on branch task-148-auto-judged-privacy at the NEXT list, in order. Use the Edit tool (not bash-heredoc python) for capture-path files — the transport mangles backslash sequences. Commit messages via -F file (heredoc stdin hung once).
