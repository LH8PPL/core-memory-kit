The claude-memory-kit accepts overlapping, near-duplicate memory captures from the same insight (captured from different angles or timestamps within a session), deferring deduplication to post-capture processing sweeps rather than preventing duplication upfront.

**Why:** Allows rapid, flexible capture without over-thinking what's worth saving; the system tolerates duplication as a natural side effect and resolves it later automatically.

**How to apply:** When reviewing memory batches, expect near-duplicates on the same topic (especially within a single session). Accept them as design intent. Never hand-edit to remove duplication; let the kit's dedup sweep (which runs periodically) consolidate them automatically.
