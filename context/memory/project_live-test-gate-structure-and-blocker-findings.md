The gate has 5 runs and two phases of checks:

- **Phase 1 (steps §0–§1)**: Unit tests + Windows input behavior. Found 3 cut-blockers (D-185, D-186, D-187), all in the "unit-green, broken on real Windows input" class. D-186 is a sub-bug of D-185; D-187 caught by BOM sweep. These would have shipped in v0.4.0 without this gate.
- **Phase 2 (KH/KC)**: Live IDE/CLI hook firing checks. Not yet reached. This is where the "does it actually fire?" risk lives.

Gate purpose: catch issues that pass unit tests but break on real Windows input.

**Why:** The live-test gate is the release-validation step that prevents shipping broken builds. Early phases catch input-handling bugs; later phases verify IDE/CLI integration works.

**How to apply:** Reference this structure when understanding gate failures, or planning Session 1 in Kiro (the live hook-check phase).
