Tasks can ride the same release lane without being merged into each other.
- Each task maintains its own tasks.md entry, design sections, decision-logging, and ADR, even when shipping in the same release.
- "Sharing a release lane" does NOT mean "merging tasks"; independence is preserved through separate documentation and ownership.
- Example: Tasks 70.4 and 74 are separate, independently-documented tasks both riding v0.4.3.

**Why:** Allows efficient release batching (multiple independent features per version) while maintaining clear traceability, decision ownership, and accountability per task.

**How to apply:** When multiple independent tasks ship in one release, keep their documentation (ADRs, design sections, decision logs) separate. Don't merge small tasks just to fill a release; instead, ride them.
