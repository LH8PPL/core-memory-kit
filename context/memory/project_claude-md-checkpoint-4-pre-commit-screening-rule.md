Before staging `context/` to public repo, scan new fact files for secrets/home-paths. This is a binding rule enforced at commit time (complement to Poison_Guard write-time screening).

**Why:** Ensures no credentials or absolute home paths are published in fact files

**How to apply:** Apply this rule at every dogfood flush; can be automated by Task 71 hook
