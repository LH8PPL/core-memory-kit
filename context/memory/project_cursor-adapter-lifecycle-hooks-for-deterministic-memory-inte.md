**Three lifecycle hooks:**
- `sessionStart` → inject memory via `additional_context` payload
- `afterAgentResponse` → capture new context/memory
- `beforeShellExecution` → guard against destructive operations

**Core innovation:** Deterministic fire cycle avoids "judgment-call failure" of MCP-only integrations (Mimir, memex), where agent must decide to invoke memory tools. Hooks fire automatically.

**Parity:** Matches Claude Code's dynamic inject; real feature equivalence, not static-rule approximation.

**Why:** Automatic, judgment-free memory capture/injection. Differentiates from MCP-only approaches and addresses Cursor user demand for lost native memory.

**How to apply:** Validate in Task 196 review that three hooks are wired, tested (5 cycles committed per prior entry), and flow is deterministic end-to-end. Each hook must fire without agent judgment.
