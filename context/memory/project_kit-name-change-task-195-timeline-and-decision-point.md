Task 195 addresses renaming the kit to reflect multi-harness support (claude-code, Kiro IDE/CLI, Cursor, Codex, etc.).

**Timeline:**
- v0.2: originally deferred via ADR-0012 (condition: "IF cross-agent ships")
- v0.4.0: condition fired when Kiro shipped
- v0.4.4 cut: decision trigger — final call to make

**Assistant's recommendation (not yet user-confirmed):**
- Middle path: keep `claude-memory-kit` as repo/npm name (lower rename cost; claude-* precedent shows it doesn't block multi-agent), but elevate `cmk` as cross-agent CLI/brand (already binary, MCP key, config dir; neutral, memorable).

**Why:** Renaming costs grow with users; ADR defer condition is now live; decision needed at v0.4.4 cut.

**How to apply:** Revisit at v0.4.4 release. Compare three options: keep current name, full rename, middle path (cmk brand / claude-* repo).
