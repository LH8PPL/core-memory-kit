- Assistant can trigger workflows with `gh workflow run` (e.g., `gh workflow run "Bench (storage bake-off)"`).
- Previously assumed user had to trigger manually via Actions → Run workflow.
- CLI approach is faster and enables tighter feedback loops than manual UI clicks.

**Why:** Assistant was over-cautious about automation scope. This capability exists and is faster than asking user to click.

**How to apply:** For tight feedback loops (perf validation, bake-offs): trigger CI workflows via CLI instead of asking user to click. Reserve user actions for outward-facing steps (tag push, publish).
