Jitter-class failures in smoke tests receive one automatic 5-second-wait retry. If still degraded after retry, the test asserts a degradation contract (preserving aged files for next week's retry) rather than failing the gate. Deterministic errors fail fast without retry.

**Why:** A single transient delay can cause false negatives; 5 seconds is low-cost. Distinguishing jitter from real degradation prevents flaky CI while preserving signal for real b
