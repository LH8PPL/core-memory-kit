The `cmk.json` file and `chat.defaultAgent: cmk` config pointer left in `~/.kiro` after testing are NOT user files — they were created during development. When present during a "fresh install" gate test, they mask whether the shipped code actually works on a clean system.

**Why:** A gate test needs to simulate a real user's first install; pre-existing config defeats that simulation

**How to apply:** Before running a fresh-install gate, remove development artifacts; the backup (step 1 of the gate) makes this safe to do
