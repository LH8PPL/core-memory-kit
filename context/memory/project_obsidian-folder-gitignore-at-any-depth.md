Gitignore pattern must exclude `.obsidian/` at any depth (e.g., `**/.obsidian/`) because Obsidian auto-creates this folder when opening any vault, creating merge/commit noise if left unignored.

**Why:** Obsidian creates .obsidian/ metadata folder automatically; without depth-inclusive pattern, different vault opens pollute the repo with uncommitted changes

**How to apply:** Ensure .gitignore uses pattern that catches .obsidian/ at any level; already fixed (D-399)
