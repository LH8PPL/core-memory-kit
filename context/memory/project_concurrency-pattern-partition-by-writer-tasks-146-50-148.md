nestwork solves multi-agent concurrency via **partition-by-writer**: each agent owns its own directory tree, eliminating write collisions without locks or CRDTs.

- AGENTS.md serves as canonical source with thin mirrors in agent-owned dirs
- Desensitization contract at write time (agent respects its partition boundary)
- No merge conflicts; no coordination overhead

**Why:** Directly applicable to multi-agent scenarios (Tasks 146/50/148). Avoids distributed-systems complexity by enforcing ownership-based write safety.

**How to apply:** Reference nestwork's agent-directory structure and AGENTS.md-mirror pattern for multi-agent write isolation.
