When testing Skill() permissions in a new folder, expect TWO independent dialogs: **(1) Workspace-trust** ("Trust this workspace?") — prerequisite for ANY settings.json rules to take effect; **(2) Skill prompt** ("Use skill X?") — feature-specific gating. Accept trust first, then proceed with Skill testing. Conflating them masks real behavior.

**Why:** Kit settings are inert until folder trust accepted; testing Skill behavior before accepting trust produces false negatives.

**How to apply:** In future Claude Code tests, accept workspace-trust before interpreting any setting-related prompts or behavior.
