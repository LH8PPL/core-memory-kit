- GitHub README (distinct from npm)
- npm README (distinct from GitHub)
- QUICKSTART doc (onboarding)
- docs/KIRO.md (existing agent surface doc)
- docs/CLAUDE-CODE.md (to create, match KIRO structure)
- docs/CURSOR.md (to create, match KIRO structure)
- DOCUMENTATION-MAP (registry for all new docs)

Prerequisite notes for each agent (Claude→`claude`, Kiro→`kiro-cli`, Cursor→`cursor-agent`) must appear in all three locations.

**Why:** The kit is distributed via GitHub and npm with separate audiences; each agent has different installation/setup prerequisites that must be clear at each entry point.

**How to apply:** Maintain parallel structure in docs/CLAUDE-CODE.md, docs/CURSOR.md, docs/KIRO.md. Update README (GitHub), npm README, and QUICKSTART. Register all in DOCUMENTATION-MAP.
