- Task has WakeToRun=False, StopIfGoingOnBatteries=True
- Distill takes ~3.4 min on 1500 facts
- Machine sleeps/logs off at 23:00, killing task mid-run
- Error code: STATUS_CONTROL_C_EXIT every night
- Sibling ytslide task at same time completes (is faster)

**Why:** Cascading failures — each night's cron dies, HC-10 doesn't catch it, outage accumulates

**How to apply:** Register-crons should set WakeToRun=True; monitor task completion not just start
