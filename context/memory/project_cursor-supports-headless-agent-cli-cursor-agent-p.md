Verified that Cursor has a headless agent command: `cursor-agent -p` (works in cloud/headless environments).

Note: GUI-only hooks (`sessionStart`, `afterAgentResponse`) don't fire in headless mode; other hooks do.

**Why:** This is a viable option for replacing the hard `claude` CLI dependency if the kit switches to per-agent backends (option c from the dependency-resolution decision).

**How to apply:** If the team chooses to use per-agent headless CLIs as backends, Cursor can use `cursor-agent -p` instead of shelling out to `claude`.
