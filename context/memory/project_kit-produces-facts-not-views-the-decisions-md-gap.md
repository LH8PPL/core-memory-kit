- Kit's 211 facts are scattered per-file, each with title/Why/How/timestamp, but no assembled chronological view
- INDEX.md is flat/alphabetical, MEMORY.md is bounded (rolls over), cmk search is pull-based (requires knowing what to search)
- DECISION-LOG.md and squad's decisions.md both provide a *chronological decision view*: one readable page, in order, with why
- Kit lacks this view layer; raw facts exist but aren't assembled into a readable journal

**Why:** Clarifies Task 147 scope — DECISIONS.md is *not* redundant with existing docs; it's the *missing view* that the kit's facts should feed into. Distinction: kit = facts, DECISION-LOG/squad = views.

**How to apply:** Build DECISIONS.md as a derived, regenerated decision journal (not append-only) that assembles facts into a readable timeline. Also consider cmk digest as a sibling all-knowledge render.
