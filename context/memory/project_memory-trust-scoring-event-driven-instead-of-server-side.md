Kit uses event-driven trust earning via audit log rather than memclaw's server-side outcome scoring.
- Recalls (`mk_get`/`mk_search` hits) increment `last_confirmed` and `use_count` in memory frontmatter
- Contradictions or supersedes decrement trust
- Trust is earned over a memory's lifetime, not frozen at capture
- All signals already on disk (audit log based); no LLM API calls on write

**Why:** Adopts memclaw's earned-trust insight without requiring server infrastructure or API costs on every write

**How to apply:** Reconcile audit log events and bump memory frontmatter fields; implement as Task 97
