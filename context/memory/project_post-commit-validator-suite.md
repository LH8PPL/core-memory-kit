Three validators run after commits to enforce consistency across files:
- **references:** Validates that all cross-file references (decision IDs, task IDs, etc.) exist and are valid.
- **name-privacy:** Ensures no secrets, tokens, or names leak into documentation.
- **numbering-gaps:** Checks for orphaned or skipped task IDs in the numbering sequence.
All should report green before shipping changes.

**Why:** Catch integration bugs early: dangling references, leaks, orphaned task IDs. These are easy to miss in manual review.

**How to apply:** After audits or major changes, run validators. Fix any failures before committing. A green run confirms all cross-file references are consistent.
