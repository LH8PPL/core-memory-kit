When installing Visual Studio C++ build tools (MSVC v143, Windows 11 SDK) on Windows, the PATH environment variable is not updated in existing terminal sessions. The C++ linker (`link.exe`) only becomes available in newly-opened PowerShell windows. Existing terminals must be closed completely; reopening the same window is not sufficient.

**Why:** Windows/PowerShell-specific behavior: PATH caching requires full shell restart to load new binaries into the process environment.

**How to apply:** After VC++ tools finish installing, close all existing terminals and open a fresh one before running build commands (cargo, cmake, etc.).
