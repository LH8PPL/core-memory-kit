SEPARATE bug found in cut-gate-v041e: the first mk_remember MCP call errored with InputValidationError "The links value wasn't a valid array" — Claude passed a malformed links param. It self-recovered on retry, but the mk_remember MCP tool's links param validation rejects what the model naturally sends. Track as a rough-edge follow-up (not a permission bug, not blocking v0.4.1 prompt-free diagnosis).

**Why:** A tool that rejects the model's natural input on first try and forces a retry is a UX rough edge worth fixing — even though it self-recovers, it wastes a turn and could confuse a less-capable model.

**How to apply:** Investigate mk_remember's links zod schema in mcp-server.mjs — likely it requires an array but the model sends a string/object. Consider coercing or loosening. File as a task in a later lane.
