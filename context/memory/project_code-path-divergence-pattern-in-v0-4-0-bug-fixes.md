Six live-test failures (D-185–D-191) stemmed from the same root cause: Claude-Code-only features not ported to their Kiro equivalents. Example: D-191/B1 (uninstall regex) would have deleted users' steering notes. All six were caught by live end-to-end verification before shipping.

**Why:** Indicates asymmetric feature coverage between Code and Kiro implementations. Understanding this pattern informs test strategy and code-review focus for remaining v0.4.0 work.

**How to apply:** For code changes, assume any Code feature likely needs a Kiro equivalent. Prioritize cross-path testing and reviews.
