The kit already bounds assistant turn size via `NOW_MD_ASSISTANT_CAP` in capture-turn, before turns land in `now.md`. The gap is it doesn't bound (a) user turn size, (b) the number of turns, or (c) input to the three compress call sites (compress-session, daily-distill, weekly-curate).

**Why:** Shows the kit isn't starting from zero on input bounding — the precedent already exists. The solution should extend this pattern rather than invent a new mechanism.

**How to apply:** When designing bounds, reference `NOW_MD_ASSISTANT_CAP` and extend its approach; reuse the kit's own precedent.
