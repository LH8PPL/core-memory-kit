Auto-generated memory captures are produced to `context/` by the extraction system but must NOT be auto-committed. They require manual review by the user and are committed separately, never auto-committed in the user's voice.

**Why:** Manual review gates ensure auto-extracted facts are accurate, well-formed, and reflect genuine intent — prevents stale or incorrect captures from being recorded as durable knowledge.

**How to apply:** When auto-extract produces changes in `context/`, leave them uncommitted. Review each capture for accuracy/relevance, edit if needed, then commit with a dedicated memory-focused commit message (separate from code PRs).
