Isolate environment probing (PATH checks, env var reads, file existence) into a pure selector function, separate from routing/invocation logic. This makes routing unit-testable without filesystem side effects and clarifies the separation between "what's available" and "what we choose to use."

**Why:** Improves testability, maintainability, and code clarity. codemem uses this pattern implicitly; explicit extraction is recommended for the kit's architecture.

**How to apply:** Create a selector function; have makeBackend call it and route based on its result. Unit tests can mock the selector without touching the filesystem.
