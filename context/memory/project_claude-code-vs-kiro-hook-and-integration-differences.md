These differences are architectural necessities (discovered during live-testing), not arbitrary divergence:
- **Hook config**: Claude Code uses `.claude/settings.json` hooks array; Kiro uses `.kiro/hooks/*.kiro.hook` files with `when`/`then` properties
- **Hook input**: Claude Code sends stdin as JSON payload; Kiro passes argv + env(USER_PROMPT) + cwd + transcript file path
- **Transcript storage**: Claude Code at `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl`; Kiro at `globalStorage/.../workspace-sessions/<base64url>/<id>.json`
- **Command form**: Claude Code runs bare bin; Kiro runs `cmd.exe /c cmk hook stop` (WSL wrapper on Windows)
- **Skills directories**: `.claude/skills/` vs `.kiro/skills/`

**Why:** Each agent has a different plugin/integration API and execution context; these differences are fundamental to how each tool works

**How to apply:** Accept these as necessary constraints. Do not attempt to unify them. Focus integration work on the thin adapter layer that bridges agent-native I/O to the shared core
