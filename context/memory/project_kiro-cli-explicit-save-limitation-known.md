The `cmk remember` CLI command in kiro-cli is flaky due to shell working-directory handling. Automatic hooks work reliably. Explicit saves should be documented as best-effort.

**Why:** Testing showed `cmk remember` facts didn't land due to kiro's shell cwd behavior — not a cmk defect, but an environment constraint.

**How to apply:** Document as kiro-cli known limitation. Recommend automatic hook-based capture. Explicit saves are unsupported until kiro shell paths stabilize.
