A bug in skill-review regarding imported facts' staleness properties was identified during live testing on the dogfood memory system, fixed, and pinned to the codebase.

**Why:** Correctness of the memory system depends on imported facts remaining fresh. This bug threatened that invariant.

**How to apply:** When working on skill-review or fact-import logic, ensure this fix remains pinned and its test coverage is maintained.
