Cut gate discovered automatic capture pipeline was broken; both legs fixed and merged. Current status:

| Leg | Status |
|---|---|
| Inject | ✅ |
| Explicit cmk remember/search | ✅ |
| Capture (turn → CLI transcript) | ✅ fixed via D-199 #226 |
| Auto-extract (turn → Haiku) | ✅ fixed via D-200 #227 |
| Wedge (cross-project → user HABITS.md) | ✅ proven live |
| Delete-guard | ✅ |

Remaining parity legs: observe-edit, prompt-capture, IDE delete-guard, IDE observe-edit.

**Why:** Establishes stable baseline for next phase; clarifies which core features are locked in vs. still under development.

**How to apply:** Build new parity legs on top of the proven core; next session can start directly on observe-edit + prompt-capture without re-deriving the cut gate findings.
