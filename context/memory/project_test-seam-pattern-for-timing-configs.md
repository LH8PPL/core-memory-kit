Expose production timing constants (debounce intervals, lock timeouts) as test-injectable parameters. This allows tests to run with tight deadlines without polluting assertions. Example: `watcherDebounceMs` allows 80ms test debounce vs 500ms production default. When tests fail under concurrent load, robustify the code to meet the original deadline rather than relaxing assertions.

**Why:** A flaky test masks real bugs. When stress-tested, Task 218's test showed 5/5 failures under full concurrency but passed in isolation. Lowering expectations defeats early detection; fix the root robustness issue instead.

**How to apply:** Use seams (injected constants, environment variables, or DI) to let tests declare their own timing. Validate "no false-green" — ensure tests still fail when the underlying fix is stashed.
