Installing @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit globally via `npm install -g` automatically recreates ~/.claude-memory-kit even if deleted. This can affect test isolation when running multiple scenarios or comparing branch states.

**Why:** Observed during post-rebuild verification; important for test design and cleanup between runs

**How to apply:** Account for this in pre/post-test cleanup; explicitly delete ~/.claude-memory-kit before running isolated tests if prior state must be excluded
