Gate was doing unbounded read of now.md on hook's hot path. now.md is the one file with no write-side cap — the very thing Task 235 bounds. Fixed: size-first on reads.

**Why:** Catching issues before they compound; now.md can grow very large (dogfood grew to 410 KB in v0.4.0)

**How to apply:** On future buffer file reads, check size first; apply bounds-aware logic
