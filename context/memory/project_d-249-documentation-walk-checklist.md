When closing a PR, verify these doc areas match the code changes:
- design.md (specific sections: §6.4b extraction fallback, §7.1.4 stale-replay guard)
- glossary (new terms introduced)
- ARCHITECTURE ("When capture fails" scenarios)
- memory-lifecycle-map (routing points, write-path variants)
- docs/CLAUDE-CODE.md (slash surfaces like /tour)
- README (≥2 bullets)
- npm README (≥2 bullets)

**N/A zones** (skip unless version-specific):
- MCP.md (CLI-only by design)
- Cursor/Codex (no slash surface)
- HEALTH-CHECKS (version-specific only)

**Why:** Prior PR #311 claimed §7.1 docs edit that was never performed. Prevents documentation drift and the overstating-commits anti-pattern.

**How to apply:** Run D-249 walk before merging. Treat as a checklist, not a spot-check.
