The exit-doors gate validates Door-3 header forms using Task-137 validators.
Actively caught Door-3 header form issues during Task 135 execution (showing it works).

**Why:** Documents validation chain; shows active error detection in prerun gating

**How to apply:** Rely on exit-doors gate to catch header form issues; do not bypass it
