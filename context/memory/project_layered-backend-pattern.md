Route layer (HTTP/WebSocket transport only) → Service layer (lifecycle, broadcast, business logic) → Repository layer (connection store) → Schemas (Pydantic contracts). Each WS connection gets its own service instance. Service avoids deep transport leakage (accepts, sends text only).

**Why:** Separates concerns so services are testable/reusable without FastAPI; prevents architectural decay.

**How to apply:** Structure FastAPI backends: api/routes.py (thin), services/ (brain), repositories/ (data), schemas/ (boundaries). Route ≤ 30 lines; service ≤ 50 lines; repo ≤ 30 lines.
