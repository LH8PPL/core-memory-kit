Saved facts include a `write_source` field indicating extraction method: `auto-extract`, `mk_remember`, explicit call, etc. Enables diagnosing which pathway succeeded and whether deduplication is masking auto-extract writes.

**Why:** Essential for debugging missing or duplicate facts across IDE gates and understanding whether auto-extract silently dedups or genuinely fails.

**How to apply:** When examining facts in Claude/Kiro/Cursor memory folders, inspect write_source to categorize which extraction mechanism fired and which did not.
