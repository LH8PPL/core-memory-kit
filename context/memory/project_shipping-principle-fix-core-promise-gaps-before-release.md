- **Core principle:** When a core/headline promise is broken AND the fix is small AND scope is verified, fix it before shipping — don't defer to the next release.
- **Example:** "Search must find the persona" is a kit-level promise, not a v0.4.3 detail. Shipping with broken search (#182–183 unfixed) is dishonest. The fix is small (paths align, parser already multi-section-capable), so fix before tagging v0.4.3, not defer to v0.4.4.

**Why:** Project opposes the lazy-framing move of shipping a product known to be broken against its headline claims. Honesty about capabilities vs. promises is foundational.

**How to apply:** Before each tag, check: is a core promise broken? Is the fix small + scoped? If both yes, fix before shipping. Defer only genuine new features/design work.
