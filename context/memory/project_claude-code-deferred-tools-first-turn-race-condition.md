- Claude Code v2.1.x freezes deferred-tool list at turn-start, before MCP servers finish connecting (10-30s typical)
- Symptom: ToolSearch fails on first turn despite healthy MCP connection and hasTools:true advertised
- Root cause: Claude Code API-side hydration layer, not server bug
- Workaround: retry on fresh turn or use CLI fallback (kit's fallback mechanism mitigates this)

**Why:** Not fixable server-side (no protocol mechanism to opt out of deferral). Known issue: Claude Code #42148 / #60052. Understanding the race explains why first-turn failures don't indicate broken code.

**How to apply:** Document in gate guide that first-turn ToolSearch misses are expected on cold start; retry resolves it. Not a gate blocker.
