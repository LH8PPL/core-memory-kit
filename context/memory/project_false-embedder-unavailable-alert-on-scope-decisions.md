When `--scope decisions` is searched (keyword-only by design), the code mistakes this for an embedder failure and prints "the embedder is unavailable — run `cmk install --with-semantic`." In reality, semantic search works fine and the embedder loads correctly. The fix is ~5 lines (silent degradation to keyword search, no misleading note). Pre-existing since v0.3.3, cosmetic severity.

**Why:** This false alarm fires on the cold-open (showcase moment), giving new users the false impression that their setup is broken when everything actually works.

**How to apply:** Scope decision pending: fix before v0.5.0 tag (small, high-impact for showcase) vs lane to v0.5.1 (don't squeeze in before tag).
