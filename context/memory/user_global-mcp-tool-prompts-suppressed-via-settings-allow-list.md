The user's `.claude\settings.json` contains a permissions allow-list:
```json
"permissions": {
  "allow": [
    "Bash(cmk:*)",
    "Skill(memory-write)",
    "Skill(memory-search)",
    "mcp__cmk__*"
  ]
}
```

The `"mcp__cmk__*"` entry suppresses per-tool-call MCP approval prompts. The kit preserves one-time server-startup approval by design (decision P-ZFEHNQY7).

**Why:** Explains why no MCP prompts appear in practice across projects. This is a global user configuration.

**How to apply:** When setting up new cmk tools or debugging missing prompts, check .claude\settings.json. To suppress prompts for new tools, extend the allow-list with patterns like `"mcp__<tool>__*"`.
