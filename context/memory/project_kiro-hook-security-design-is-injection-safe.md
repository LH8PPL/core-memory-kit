The `.kiro.hook` command and prompt-capture pipeline naturally prevents shell injection:
- Hook command is fixed (`cmd.exe /c cmk hook promptSubmit`) — no dynamic interpolation
- `USER_PROMPT` env var read **inside** Node process only (never spliced into shell command string)
- Captured content passes through Poison_Guard before file write
- This design matches AWS's recommended pattern for deterministic hook safety (prefer `runCommand` over `askAgent`)

**Why:** AWS's "Mastering Agent Hooks" article confirmed this approach is the authoritative best practice, not novel/risky. The security concern from the AWS article (sanitizing prompts) is already handled by the kit's existing infrastructure.

**How to apply:** When building orchestrator (`cmk install --ide kiro`), use the fixed hook command pattern and trust the existing Poison_Guard screening — no additional sanitization needed.
