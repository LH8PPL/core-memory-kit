Editing `hooks.json` while Cursor is running can cause its file watcher to desync, potentially causing the new configuration to not be picked up reliably.

**Why:** Known Cursor limitation affecting hook configuration changes during active sessions.

**How to apply:** Prefer restarting Cursor after modifying `hooks.json`, or avoid mid-session edits to hooks.json specifically.
