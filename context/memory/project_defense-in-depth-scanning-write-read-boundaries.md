Content scanned at write-time AND re-scanned when read from disk into prompt snapshot. Catches on-disk poisoning that bypassed write-time check.

**Why:** Protects against file-level tampering; relevant for memory system where files persist between sessions

**How to apply:** Consider implementing two-point scanning if on-disk file integrity is part of threat model for final design
