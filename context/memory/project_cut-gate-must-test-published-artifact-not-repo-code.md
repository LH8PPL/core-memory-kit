The cut-gate testing harness has an explicit rule: never test against the repo binary. Always test against the published, globally-installed tarball. Testing the wrong version (repo vs. published) is a known failure mode that can mask bugs.

**Why:** The cut-gate's purpose is to verify the live artifact users will receive. Testing repo code means missing bugs that only appear in the published tarball, defeating the test's entire purpose.

**How to apply:** Before running the cut-gate, ensure the global `cmk` is freshly installed from the tarball and matches the version under test. Verify with `cmk --version` and spot-check key files (e.g., confirm `isJournalStale` exists in `lazy-compress.mjs`). Never attempt to run the cut-gate against repo code or a stale global install.
