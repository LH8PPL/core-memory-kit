**Rule:** Session memory must contain mission context and genuine user facts only. Kit operational issues, debugging artifacts, and tool noise do NOT go in memory.

**Enforcement (both directions):**
- **Capture:** Exclude-on-doubt filter — when unsure, treat as kit noise (recoverable via retry)
- **Reporting:** Kit-health signals only via ephemeral systemMessage (shown once, never persisted)

**Where kit issues belong:** DECISION-LOG.md, tasks.md, or ephemeral display — NOT memory tiers

**Why:** Operational noise in session memory pollutes the user's mission context every session. A failure notification in memory that loads automatically becomes a repeated nag without user action, training users to ignore that channel when it genuinely matters.

Both capture and reporting layers can pollute memory equally, so both must enforce this separation.

**How to apply:** When designing capture/reporting/persistence: classify content as mission context or kit noise. Route accordingly. In capture, treat ambiguous content as kit noise (safer than pollution; content is recoverable via retry). In reporting, show kit-health once, ephemerally only, never auto-load.
