The memory-kit's validator enforces that all references to ADRs/decisions actually exist. Because the kit captures live session conversations, it catches forward-references (references to not-yet-existing ADRs) even in the kit's own use. This is self-validation through dogfooding.

**Why:** The strictness is intentional — it ensures documentation consistency by immediately surfacing gaps. When the kit references an ADR in conversation, the validator catches it if that ADR doesn't exist yet.

**How to apply:** When validator errors occur about missing ADRs, write the referenced ADR (or use the provisional pattern above). Don't suppress validation; it's helping enforce documentation completeness.
