When implementation diverges from prior research or spec conclusions, the divergence must be explicitly recorded in decision trail (research notes or DECISION-LOG). Include what was proposed, what was built instead, and why. Failing to do this violates the project's decision-trail rule.

**Why:** Traceability and informed review. Future maintainers must know both the original decision and the reasons for change; prevents the same design question from being reconsidered.

**How to apply:** After implementing per research, compare to spec. If diverged, update research note or DECISION-LOG to record divergence and rationale.
