When evaluating external sources or prior art (e.g., Octopoda), tag all claims as either:
  - **code-verified** (with file paths) — claim checked against actual implementation
  - **README-only** — claim from documentation only
Rationale: External projects have a history of shipping less than their READMEs promise; verification is essential to avoid building on unreliable claims.

**Why:** Maintains research quality and prevents adopting unproven external ideas as-is

**How to apply:** Apply this discipline when reviewing Octopoda findings and any future external source evaluations
