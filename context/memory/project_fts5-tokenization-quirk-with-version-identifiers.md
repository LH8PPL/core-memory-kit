Full-text search (FTS5) tokenizes hyphenated/dotted identifiers like "v0.3.2" into separate tokens, breaking direct token-match queries on version strings

**Why:** Discovered during D-259 design work when building same-subject candidate search by version tokens

**How to apply:** Use quoted phrase queries or explicit MATCH syntax for version/state tokens in FTS5 predicates; note as known limitation in search implementation
