When a cmk-installed workspace folder is renamed, its absolute path changes, which invalidates the per-workspace permissions.yaml hash that was baked during `cmk install`. The old permissions hash will no longer match the new path.

**Solution:** After renaming, run `cmk install --ide <ide-name>` to re-stamp the per-workspace permissions.yaml under the new path hash. This operation is idempotent and fast — it only re-keys per-workspace configuration. The global agent (e.g., kiro-cli) is unaffected; only per-workspace permission bits need re-keying.

**Why:** Renaming without re-installing silently breaks the permission binding. Re-installing immediately after rename keeps the permissions hash in sync with the folder's absolute path.

**How to apply:** When renaming a cmk-installed workspace, immediately run `cmk install --ide <ide-name>` before running any workspace-aware operations.
