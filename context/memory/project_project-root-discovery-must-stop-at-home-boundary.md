The discovery walkers (`discoverProjectRoot`, `resolveMcpProjectRoot`) previously could escape into `$HOME` if a stray `~/context/` existed elsewhere.

**The bug**: `cmk mcp serve` from `/tmp/foo` could serve the wrong project if `~/context/` existed.

**The fix**:
- Both walkers now stop at `$HOME` 
- `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` env var can override/customize
- `context.local/` is now recognized for local-only projects

**Why:** This was a real footgun: project discovery should be contained within its own tree, not escape upward into unrelated user directories.

**How to apply:** When reviewing discovery logic or adding new walkers, ensure they respect the `$HOME` boundary and use `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR` override semantics.
