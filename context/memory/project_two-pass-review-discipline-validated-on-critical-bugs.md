After Tasks 232–233, implementer + reviewer two-pass caught TWO critical bugs invisible to implementer's own test suite: Task 232 (infinite re-walk, Important severity) and Task 233 (privacy leak to disk, Blocking severity). Both reproduced, not hypothetical. Validates the cost against the "five-PR precedent" justification.

**Why:** Confirms review overhead is justified by real-world catch rate on production-critical issues

**How to apply:** Continue two-pass review for major implementation tasks. Prioritize reproduction of reviewer concerns (do not dismiss as hypothetical).
