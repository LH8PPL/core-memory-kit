- **Task:** `cmk-daily-distill` (nightly scheduled task)
- **Issue:** Unwanted console-window popup during nightly execution (observed at 23:01)
- **Root cause:** Task launched with visible console window
- **Fix approach:** Windowless-launch configuration via `register-crons` script
- **Tracking:** Task 215 (implementation + unit-test autopilot; live verification flagged for user)

**Why:** Console popup disrupts nightly automation; next session needs to know the issue scope and fix approach for Task 215 execution.

**How to apply:** When Task 215 is active, implement windowless-launch via `register-crons` and unit-test; then coordinate with user for live registration verification on the real host scheduler.
