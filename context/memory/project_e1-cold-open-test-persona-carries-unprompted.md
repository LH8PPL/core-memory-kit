E1 validates that established persona (from `~/.claude-memory-kit/` in HABITS.md, USER.md, LESSONS.md) automatically carries to brand-new projects without explicit instruction.

Success criteria — the scaffold response should provide unprompted:
- Layered architecture: `app/{api,services,repositories,schemas,core}/` + `main.py`
- `uv` for package management, `ruff` for pre-commit linting
- Type hints (Python 3.12+) and tests-first approach
- (Optional) plain HTML UI if frontend included

Trigger phrase: "Start a new Python backend — set up the structure."

**Why:** E1 is the core validation that persona injection works across projects; without it, the cold-open moment (unprompted conventions) fails

**How to apply:** Run by (1) create fresh folder, (2) `git init && cmk install --with-semantic`, (3) fully quit/reopen Claude Code, (4) ask for Python backend scaffold. Check response against four criteria; each one it applies unprompted indicates persona successfully injected.
