As of branch `fix-kiro-cli-mcp-project-resolution`, commit a60b11a:
- All 3 agents working: Claude Code, Kiro IDE, kiro-cli
- No unwanted popup (`includeMcpJson: false`)
- Automatic memory hooks operational
- Explicit `cmk remember`/`cmk search` commands functional
- Dead MCP project machinery removed (~46 net lines)

Code is clean, tested, validated. Ready for v0.4.0 release prep.

**Why:** Represents the end state of a long debugging cycle; system is stable and proven.

**How to apply:** Use as baseline for v0.4.0 release workflow. Optional: test bare `cmk remember` (no `--project` flag) to determine if further simplification is possible.
