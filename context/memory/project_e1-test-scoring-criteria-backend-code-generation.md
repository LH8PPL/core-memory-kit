E1 measures whether memory affects **how code is built** (architecture, tooling, patterns), not **what** is built (product choice). Score as **PASS** if the cold-open scaffold unprompted includes:
- `uv` for dependency management (not pip)
- `.venv` folder creation
- Type hints on all function signatures (Python 3.12+ style)
- Tests-first approach with dedicated tests folder
- Layered architecture split: api / services / repositories / schemas
- `ruff` linting executed before any assistant-committed code

Absence of these signals → **FAIL** (memory did not influence code generation style).

**Why:** E1 validates that memory successfully embedded the user's backend philosophy (FastAPI, type safety, testing discipline) into code generation without explicit prompting. This is the core efficacy test.

**How to apply:** In future cold-opens, evaluate the assistant's first scaffold against this checklist. 5+ criteria present unprompted = memory working.
