The kit currently provides:
- `cmk timeline` — per-fact history
- `recent-activity` — time-window view
- **Missing**: Chronological decision-journal view (what decisions were made, in order, with their whys)

Both squad's `decisions.md` journal and the kit's own `DECISION-LOG.md` (D-1…D-131, hand-maintained as source-of-truth) show this view is valuable enough that users build it by hand. Task 147 will add this view to `cmk digest`.

**Why:** User pattern discovery — manual decision journaling across multiple teams signals a real user need the kit doesn't yet meet

**How to apply:** Reference when scoping Task 147; the manual D-log is the existing pattern to validate against
