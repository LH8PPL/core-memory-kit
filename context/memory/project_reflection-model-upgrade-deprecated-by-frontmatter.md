EverOS uses a structured reflection flow: Select → Merge → Re-extract → Deprecate, with frontmatter `deprecated_by` marking superseded entries. This is more principled than the kit's rolling-window approach for the persona/consolidation layer.

**Why:** Task 151 (persona consolidation) needs a robust reflection strategy; EverOS's pattern is proven and more systematic.

**How to apply:** For Task 151, evaluate adopting EverOS's `deprecated_by` frontmatter and Select→Merge→Re-extract→Deprecate flow instead of rolling-window.
