INDEX can lag behind actual memory files (cosmetic; doesn't break recall). On next capture, `reindex()` rebuilds INDEX wholesale from all files on disk, healing the drift incidentally.

**Current state:** Works but undocumented; no test guarantees it.

**Decision:** Pin with a test to make this behavior contractual. Do not add SessionStart auto-heal machinery (would add I/O to the hot path for a cosmetic issue).

**Related healing:** HC-4 detects drift; search DB auto-heals separately.

**Why:** The incidental next-capture self-heal is sufficient and costs nothing at runtime. SessionStart machinery would over-engineer a vanishingly rare edge case.

**How to apply:** Write a test validating INDEX rebuilds on next capture after drift. Do not add SessionStart scanning.
