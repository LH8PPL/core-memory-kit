Scanners run daily (not weekly as originally proposed). Advisory velocity on this surface is 2 advisories per 24h on ~8 direct dependencies. Weekly cadence would permit up to 7 days of unknown exposure.

**Why:** Minimize supply-chain risk exposure window.

**How to apply:** When deciding scan frequency, ground the decision in recent advisory velocity from real data, not abstract SLA.
