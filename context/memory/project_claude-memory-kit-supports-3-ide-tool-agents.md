- Claude Code (web / Claude IDE)
- Kiro (terminal CLI)
- Cursor (Cursor IDE)

Each agent requires its own cut-gate release validation guide, surface documentation (docs/), and prerequisite notes in README/quickstart.

**Why:** The kit must provide agent-specific installation, usage, and release validation steps for each of its three agents.

**How to apply:** When creating docs/guides, produce one per agent (Claude, Kiro, Cursor), each with agent-specific commands, file paths, and validation checks.
