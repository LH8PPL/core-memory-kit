After code is merged to main, the globally-installed `cmk` binary does not auto-update. Rebuild steps:
1. `cd C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit\packages\cli`
2. `npm pack`
3. `npm uninstall -g @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit`
4. `npm install -g .\lh8ppl-claude-memory-kit-0.4.0.tgz`
5. Verify: `cmk --version`

**Why:** Global npm installs are cached locally; source changes don't propagate to the installed binary

**How to apply:** After merging code changes, run this sequence before running doctor checks or other verification
