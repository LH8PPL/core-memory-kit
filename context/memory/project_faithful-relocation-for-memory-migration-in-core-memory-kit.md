When migrating memory files between directories (e.g., from staging to canonical location), preserve files' original metadata by faithful relocation + reindexing, rather than re-ingestion via `cmk remember`. Re-ingestion via `cmk remember` re-stamps `created_at` to today, misrepresenting when knowledge was captured. Faithful relocation treats already-screened files as vetted artifacts and preserves semantic integrity of the archive.

**Why:** Timeline accuracy is essential to memory system integrity. Corrupting `created_at` dates obscures when knowledge was actually learned and breaks retrospective utility of the archive.

**How to apply:** When relocating memories, move the files + reindex to preserve ids and dates. Reserve re-capture for genuinely new facts, not for moving existing ones.
