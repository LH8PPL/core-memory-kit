Task 146 (Claude Code Workflows) is designed to test the kit's support for concurrent subagent swarms with shared memory. The critical untested component is concurrent `mk_remember` calls under swarm load — this is the validation needed before claiming the kit can support stateful swarms.

The kit's architectural role: it is the "shared-context substrate" (the middle band) that makes concurrent pipelines stateful, NOT the orchestration/chaining framework. The kit should remain reusable and modular, not expand to manage pipeline orchestration.

**Why:** The kit's strength is as a shared memory layer for many independent agents. Concurrent safety is the missing validation needed before swarm support is proven.

**How to apply:** Task 146 test harness should validate that multiple concurrent agents can safely call `mk_remember` without race conditions or memory corruption. Concurrent writes to shared memory under swarm load is the critical path.
