**Key quirks discovered during D-194 integration:**
- Corrupt `.vscode/settings.json` was previously fatal (aborted install); now non-fatal with warning + skip (graceful degradation)
- CLI regex must be start-anchored (`^cmk hook .*`) — unanchored regex could match mid-string commands
- Uninstall trust removal uses exact-string matching (low collision risk, documented in code)

**Design principles:**
- Never use blanket wildcards (kit commands only, scoped narrowly)
- Preserve user's existing settings (array-union, not overwrite)
- Security: no injection paths, tested for blanket-wildcard regressions

**Why:** These quirks represent edge cases + gotchas discovered in live testing; design principles prevent future bugs and security issues.

**How to apply:** When extending or debugging trusted-commands, remember: test with corrupt settings.json, anchor regexes, never widen scope beyond kit commands, preserve user config.
