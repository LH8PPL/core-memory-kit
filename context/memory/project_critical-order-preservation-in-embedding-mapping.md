When batching embeddings, output vector order must exactly match input body order. If extractor() returns fewer vectors than inputs, the tail mapping silently shifts — later plans get wrong embeddings in the durable content-addressed cache.

**Why:** Cache is sha-indexed, so bad embeddings persist across sessions and corrupt all future queries. Silent failure — no error raised, just wrong results downstream.

**How to apply:** Always assert output_vectors.length ≡ input_bodies.length before mapping. Fail-closed ({ok:false, reason:...}) rather than silently corrupting cache. Test with spy-extractor that varies output length.
