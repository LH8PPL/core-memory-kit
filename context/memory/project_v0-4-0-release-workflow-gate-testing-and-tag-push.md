**State**: v0.4.0 merged, CHANGELOG complete, package.json versioned. NOT tagged/published.

**Gate process** (`docs/process/cut-gate-kiro.md`):
- KH1–KH3: IDE hooks (agentStop capture, promptSubmit inject)
- KC1–KC4: CLI agent-config hooks (agentSpawn inject, stop capture)  
- KG-guard: delete-guardrail preToolUse + blocking
- ⚠️ Open blocker: Kiro matcher regex alternation support (`execute_bash|executeBash|shell`). See I3-live (D-193).

**Roles**: Assistant prepares code & pre-gate checks. User tests Kiro against fresh install, then tags v0.4.0 → auto-publish.

**Why:** Kiro testing needs real IDE/CLI exercise. Tag push is user-controlled public action. Clear boundaries prevent deadlock.

**How to apply:** User walks gate checklist, reports failures. Assistant fixes. Once gate passes (blocker resolved), user tags.
