1. Rebuild the global kit
2. Backup `~/.kiro` and user tier config to a fresh run directory
3. Remove test artifacts (leftover `agents/cmk.json`, `chat.defaultAgent: cmk` pointer) to ensure genuinely fresh state
4. Run `cmk install --ide kiro` with no pre-existing config
5. Execute on-disk verification checks (KCG1-8)
6. Drive Session 1 live

**Why:** Tests that the kit ships and installs cleanly on a fresh system without test state contamination skewing results

**How to apply:** Follow this sequence for all cutgate fresh-install tests going forward; the artifact-cleanup step is critical to maintain isolation
