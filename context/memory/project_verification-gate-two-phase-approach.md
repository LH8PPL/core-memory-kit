Verification split into two phases:
- **Phase 1 (KG-series)**: Read-only scaffolding/structure validation. Fast, no environment dependencies.
- **Phase 2 (KH/KC-series)**: Live IDE+CLI hook checks. Requires Kiro environment. Runs after KG passes and artifact rebuilt.

**Why:** Decouples fast scaffolding checks from slow live-environment checks; allows gate to flow while environment setup happens

**How to apply:** In future runs, complete all KG tests first (they are fast), then KH/KC only when in live IDE; rebuild artifact between phases
