The project uses a pre-commit hook that automatically catches and sanitizes username leaks and other sensitive data in dogfood fact files before commits. Demonstrated in this session catching a real username leak.

**Why:** Prevents accidental credential or identity disclosure in the codebase

**How to apply:** When adding facts/documentation, rely on the pre-commit hook to catch identity leaks before commit
