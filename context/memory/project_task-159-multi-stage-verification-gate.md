Commit gate for high-stakes tasks:
  1. Unit tests (42/42 lazy file, 1994/1994 full suite)
  2. Live tests on real data (DJ5 primary/fallback paths, I1 fix validation)
  3. Two-pass review: self-review (caught perf fix) + skill-assisted review (caught I1 issue)
  4. Stress test gate (5/5 or documented jitter exception)
  5. Commit only when all gates clear

**Why:** Task 159 is performance-critical with subtle interactions (lazy bin + journal sync). Multi-stage gate catches issues unit tests alone miss; the I1 fix was only visible in live-test, and skill-review caught a separate issue self-review missed.

**How to apply:** For future complex tasks, design a similar sequential gate. Each stage guards different failure modes (unit = logic, live = real-data interaction, review = design correctness, stress = load-bearing).
