Every deferred task must specify a checkable trigger (not "when ready").
Before each minor release: walk deferred tasks and render verdict (pull in / keep-deferred-with-trigger / kill).
No task survives two consecutive minors without explicit verdict — forces resolution instead of rot.
Scheduled triage pass for all stuck tasks at v0.4.4 cut.

**Why:** User identified a real problem — 18+ tasks since v0.1 still unshipped because "ready" is not testable. This rule adds a forcing function: named triggers + mandatory sweep → prevents indefinite deferral.

**How to apply:** At each minor release cut, walk deferred-task list, check triggers, decide explicitly. No task survives two minors without verdict.
