Do not implement CLI-detection logic (in `cmk install` or `cmk doctor`) before researching how each agent is actually deployed on each platform.
- **Risk example**: assuming "Windows Cursor users have cursor-agent on PATH" produces false "CLI is missing" warnings if users actually use WSL or a community binary
- **Why it matters**: a false positive is worse than no check — it damages user trust and blocks correct setups
- **Apply to**: Task 200 (shared `agentCliOnPath(kind)` detector) and any future install/doctor checks

**Why:** Unvalidated platform assumptions risk producing false positives on correct installations, blocking users with valid setups; pre-research implementation prevents encoding environment-specific assumptions as universal truth

**How to apply:** Complete Wave 0 research (how each agent is deployed, CLI locations, environment setup per platform) before wiring detector logic for install-time or health-check warnings
