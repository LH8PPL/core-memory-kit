The project designates `specs/tasks.md` "▶ Current state — what's next" as THE single source of "where are we and next action" per the documentation-map. In practice: when releases ship, the DECISION-LOG breadcrumb updates (currently knows v0.3.3 + Task 159 in progress) but the Spine does NOT (still states v0.1.2 shipped, v0.2 in progress). Releases v0.2.0, v0.2.3, v0.2.4, v0.3.0, v0.3.1, v0.3.2, v0.3.3 shipped without Spine update. Cold-start reads get wrong mental model; worse, the documented authoritative source disagrees with the actual authority.

**Why:** Drift occurs because releases are cut and documented elsewhere without proactively refreshing the Spine. This repeats the same error class as Task 159 triplication and cut-gate-as-journal — state in multiple places, not maintained in the designated home.

**How to apply:** Establish a release procedure: before shipping, update the Spine "Current state" section (and other Spine sections that reference state) to match DECISION-LOG. Alternatively, during cold-start in next session, refresh the Spine to restore documentation-map integrity.
