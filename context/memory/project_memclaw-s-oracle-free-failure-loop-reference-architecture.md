1. Agent self-reports outcome: "I acted on memory X and it failed"
2. Memory weight drops (−0.15, asymmetric)
3. Weight ranks retrieval (failed memory surfaces less)
4. LLM synthesizes corrective if/then rule from failure
5. No oracle needed; no benchmark reward required

**Why:** Proves the loop is transferable to session-host without ground-truth oracle. Only code precedent that closes contradiction→weight→ranking pipeline.

**How to apply:** Reference when designing failure-learning mechanism. Key innovation: self-report is sufficient judge; asymmetric decay avoids trust collapse on single failure.
