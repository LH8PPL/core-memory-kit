Test 3 ("where does business logic live and why") showed the assistant still performed a Glob+Read code crawl rather than leading with memory, despite D-153 changes (skill description, per-prompt hint, CLAUDE.md preamble). The fix addresses what the *instructions* say; live re-test post-merge will determine whether the *model behavior* changed.

**Why:** The user is systematically verifying whether a fix actually produces the intended behavior. Unit tests pass, but they verify well-formedness, not live behavior — especially important for LLM-sensitive recall.

**How to apply:** After merge, re-run the 2 failing prompts ("how is this structured", "where does business logic live") in the deployed version to confirm the skill fires and leads with memory.
