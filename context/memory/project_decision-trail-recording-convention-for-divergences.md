When implementation diverges from research or original design, document in three places with what-was-planned / what-shipped / why:
- Research note: add "Implementation divergences" section per decision-trail rule
- Design doc: link relevant sections (e.g., §8.2.4 for composition reasoning)
- DECISION-LOG: dated FIX+NOTE at top, tied back to decision ID (e.g., D-169)

Prevents paper-trail gaps where divergences are discovered only in retrospect.

**Why:** Maintains traceability and accountability; enables future context recovery and decision history.

**How to apply:** Update all three artifacts immediately when implementation diverges from plan; don't batch until review.
