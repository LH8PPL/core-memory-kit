Task 50 highest unverified risk: Kiro transcript format is UNKNOWN. The kit's extract/compress path hardcodes Claude-Code touchpoints (~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session>.jsonl, env -u CLAUDECODE); porting to Kiro requires parameterizing these per-agent and kiro.dev primary docs do NOT cover Kiro's transcript-on-disk shape. Must be discovered LIVE at build time.

**Why:** The transcript layer is the one part of the Claude-Code integration that is deeply host-coupled and was NOT verifiable from docs; it gates the capture half of the kit's model on Kiro.

**How to apply:** At Task 50 build, open a real Kiro CLI session and inspect where/how it stores turn transcripts BEFORE claiming the capture path works; record live result in the Task 50 DECISION-LOG entry; do not mark verified until exercised.
