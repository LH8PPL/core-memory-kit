Medium-confidence persona candidates automatically promoted on weekly curate pass via `resolvePersonaReviewQueue` wired into `autoDrainQueues`.

**Issue**: Candidates graded medium (inferred, not explicitly stated) were placed in review queue but never drained—preferences stuck and didn't inject into new projects.

**Fix** (commit b43e788):
- Implemented resolvePersonaReviewQueue → autoDrainQueues integration
- Unit + integration test (weeklyCurate → drain → persona path)
- Verified on user's real data: 6 stranded candidates promoted
- Test suite: 1900/1900 passing

**Why:** The wedge test was failing because persona wasn't injecting into new projects; medium-confidence signals were stuck with no escape path.

**How to apply:** Next cold-open should show auto-scaffolding with correct layered structure; new projects will inherit persona without explicit instruction.
