After a fix passes all verification gates and is merged to main:
1. Commit to main
2. PR and merge (gates already passed)
3. Re-pack tarball (release artifact)
4. **Session 2 (recall)** — the last interactive validation gate before tagging
5. Tag (final production release)

Session 2 (recall) is an explicit manual review checkpoint.

**Why:** Provides a staged release workflow with a final interactive review opportunity before the irreversible tag step.

**How to apply:** After merging a fix, sequence through tarball re-pack, then Session 2 (recall) for final review, then tag. Session 2 is a hard gate — nothing ships without it.
