Pre-session verification for Session 1 has three sequential gates:

**Gate 1: File-side checks** (completed independently, pre-session)
- G0–G7 and artifact integrity (version, install/doctor pass, memory safety gates, scaffold cleanliness, MCP registration, allow-list, tarball completeness)
- Status: all passing ✓

**Gate 2: In-session verification** (user-executed, marked ★)
- `/hooks` command to verify `cmk-*` hooks active
- Open memory once (checks G2)
- W1 (memory-search read-only) fires prompt-free
- W2 (hybrid mode paraphrase) demonstrates recall

**Gate 3: Live-test validation** (automated sandbox, final gate)
- Run live-test against real artifact in sandbox (a few minutes)
- Report: test result + model-cache size
- This result unblocks session1 to proceed

Session1 cannot start until all three gates pass.

**Why:** Multi-stage verification (file-side / in-session / live-test) catches config issues, integration problems, and artifact integrity before release.

**How to apply:** File-side ✓ done. User runs ★ in-session checks next (e.g., `/hooks`). Then await live-test result to clear session1 go-ahead.
