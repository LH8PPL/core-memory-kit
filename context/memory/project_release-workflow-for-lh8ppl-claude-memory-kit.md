1. Ensure CI tests pass on main branch
2. Verify dogfood memory is committed and screened (name-validator + gitignore compliance)
3. `git checkout main && git pull` — fetch latest including memory commit
4. `git tag v0.5.0` — tag the release (update version as needed)
5. `git push origin v0.5.0` — push tag to origin
6. GitHub Actions workflow `publish.yml` is automatically triggered
7. Workflow runs full test suite, then publishes to npm with provenance
8. Workflow creates GitHub Release from CHANGELOG `[0.5.0]` section

**Why:** Ensures releases are tested, documented, memory-synchronized, and auditable

**How to apply:** Follow this procedure for future releases; update version numbers and changelog accordingly
