Development sequence for v0.4.4:
- 66.1 (shape field, TDD)
- 66.3 (expiry sweep)
- grill contradiction-detection design
- 66.2/66.4
- riders 150 (ADR-first), 141a (npm-12 HC)

Key constraint: `expires_at` field appears in zero source files — it is design-prose only, so task 66.3 covers both halves (accept field + enforce sweep).

**Why:** Confirms task sequencing and identifies that expires_at needs to be added to source as part of 66.3, not assumed to exist

**How to apply:** Follow this sequence when implementing v0.4.4; treat 66.1 as entry point, use TDD approach
