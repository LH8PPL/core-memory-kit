v0.5.1 AUTOPILOT RESUME POINT (2026-07-11): Tasks 203/204 SHIPPED (PR #272, ADR-0020 resumable jobs) · 205 SHIPPED (PR #273, half-install boundary + install preflight; the live probe caught the quoted-"mcp" "serve" real-payload bug) · 206 code-complete + checkpoint-committed on branch task-206-preroll-name-window (commit 5bc4186; gate suite+stress was running at checkpoint — verify it passed, then skill-review pass, PR, squash-merge, retro). REMAINING v0.5.1 lane in order: 207 (BOM-harden the 4 Claude-Code hook bins via parseHookStdin), 213 (provenance pointers in distill — note: rides the 203/204-refactored per-day distill), 214 (name-guard --untracked), 215 (schtask console popup, WakeToRun surface), 216 (screenBeforeCommittedWrite helper at 4 sites), 219 (busy_timeout pragma), 220 (duplicate managed-block). Discipline per task: read-docs-first, branch-first, TDD, LIVE-probe the real surface (the D-314 lesson — it caught a real bug on first use), suite+stress 5/5, two-pass review, docs walk, checkbox+D-entry in the same PR, retro after merge, watch ci.yml BY NAME.

**Why:** Context compaction hit mid-lane; the next session must continue the v0.5.1 autopilot without re-deriving the task order, per-task discipline, or in-flight state.

**How to apply:** Start by checking the Task 206 gate result (.test-logs/last-run.json + .stress-logs), then PR/merge 206, then proceed 207→220 in the listed order on fresh branches off main.
