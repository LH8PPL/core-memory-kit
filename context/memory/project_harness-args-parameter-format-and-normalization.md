The workflow harness delivers the `args` parameter as a JSON string rather than as a parsed object. Agents/scripts must normalize this in their parsing layer. The current args normalizer script handles both string and object forms transparently, eliminating the failure mode where scripts assume object form.

**Why:** Initial workflow run failed immediately when args normalizer was not present (harness sent string, script expected object). After fixing the normalizer, agents spawned successfully and the workflow proceeded on pace.

**How to apply:** When writing new agent scripts for this harness, include args parsing that tolerates both string and object forms. Use the established normalizer script when available.
