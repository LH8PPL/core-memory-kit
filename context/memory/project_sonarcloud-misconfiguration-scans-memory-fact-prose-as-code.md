SonarCloud is configured to scan `context/memory/`, which contains markdown fact prose (not source code). When fact bodies include Windows file paths (e.g., `C:/proj/context`), SonarCloud's Linux runner reports false opendir errors, creating a persistent red check despite CI.yml passing GREEN.

  **Fix:** Add `context/` to `sonar.exclusions` in the SonarCloud configuration.

**Why:** Recurring false-positives in advisory checks dilute signal over time; fixing them maintains integrity.

**How to apply:** Apply the sonar.exclusions exclusion if not yet done. This is a known follow-up task.
