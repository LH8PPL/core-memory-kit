**Scope:** Extend Task 105 (lazy `now.md` → `today` roll) to handle large sessions and prevent bloat traps.
**Includes:** size-triggered roll, bounded compression, sync catch-up, observability, cmk doctor health-check command.
**Lane:** v0.4.x (next version).
**Bundling:** Per user request, bundled with Task 105 and 106 in the release plan.
**Status:** Filed, laned, not yet implemented.

**Why:** Task 105 works reliably at ~10 KB scale, but fails silently at 400+ KB. Task 167 extends the mechanism to be robust at scale.

**How to apply:** For the v0.4.x implementation session, treat Task 167 as the primary fix; Task 105 is already complete. Reference D-205 (symptom) and D-206 (root cause) in the decision log for diagnostic context.
