**Survey:** 27 total systems (18 wave-1 + 9 wave-2). Wave-2 systems include MUSE, Evo-Memory/ReMem, and 7 others.
**Classification fields:**
- learns_from_failure (boolean / partial)
- failure_mechanism (description)
- outcome_signal (source of signal)
- signal_needs_oracle (yes-benchmark-oracle / no-oracle-free)
- transferable_to_session_host (yes/no relative to CMK constraints)
- novel_signal (new types discovered)

**Why:** This scope and taxonomy define what was actually measured and its limits. Benchmark-oracle systems are out-of-scope for session-host learning; "transferable" is assessed relative to CMK's constraints, not benchmarks.

**How to apply:** When citing the survey, reference the full 27-system scope. Apply this taxonomy to classify new systems consistently. Treat benchmark-oracle systems as lessons but not templates.
