On Windows, `npm uninstall` may report EPERM (permission denied) when attempting to remove `better_sqlite3.node` — the DLL is locked by a process or OS lock. However:
- The package removal still succeeds overall ("removed 136 packages")
- Only a cosmetic temp directory is left behind
- This is a known Windows quirk; not a data loss or functional problem

Keeping better_sqlite3 is intentional despite this quirk (it has better perf than node:sqlite alternatives).

**Why:** Helps distinguish a non-blocker (EPERM on .node) from actual failures during uninstall/install cycles.

**How to apply:** Ignore EPERM on better_sqlite3.node during npm uninstall. The package is still removed. Clean up the temp dir manually if needed, but it's not critical.
