Once #215 merges, the next steps are:

1. Rebuild the artifact
2. Re-verify KG7 passes on the installed binary
3. User performs Session 1 in Kiro (live capture/inject checks)

No action needed until #215 merges; then this is the defined continuation.

**Why:** This is the planned workflow to complete the live-test gate and verify full IDE/CLI integration before release.

**How to apply:** After #215 is merged, follow these steps in order. Session 1 in Kiro requires the user (not the assistant) for live testing.
