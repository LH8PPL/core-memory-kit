Gate work is split into **user pre-work** (rebuild global, kill servers, capture signal) and **assistant automation** (backup, fresh install, on-disk validation). Only the final live-chat part (driving the probes through the IDE) is manual user work. This keeps the gate reproducible and isolates what only the user can do (interact with their Kiro IDE).

**Why:** User system-specific actions (rebuild, local state) must be done by the user; assistant can automate the rest. Clear phase separation reduces gate failures from missed setup steps.

**How to apply:** After user pre-work, expect assistant to confirm "gate ready for live part" before starting the interactive probe runs.
