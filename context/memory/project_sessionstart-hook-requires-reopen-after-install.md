When installing claude-memory-kit, the SessionStart hook that injects the persona snapshot only loads if Claude Code is fully quit and reopened **after** running `cmk install`. Sessions opened before or during installation will not load the hook.

**Why:** D-262 lesson; prerequisite for persona injection to work, critical for E1 (cold-open) testing where persona must carry unprompted to new projects

**How to apply:** After `cmk install --with-semantic`, fully quit and restart Claude Code before testing new projects. Do not rely on persona injection if the session started before the install completed.
