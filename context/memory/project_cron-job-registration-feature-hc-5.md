Cron registration enables scheduled background distill/curate cycles instead of relying only on lazy SessionStart fallback. Status on this repo: not registered (optional feature). Can be enabled with `cmk register-crons` — touches host scheduler, requires user approval.

**Why:** Without cron, lazy SessionStart fallback is the only automatic distill path, which starves on busy repos (cascade-starvation). Scheduled cron runs provide reliable daily/weekly cycles — the real fix for staleness on high-activity dogfood/test projects.

**How to apply:** For busy repos, recommend `cmk register-crons`. Requires explicit user approval before execution (scheduler integration). This is a feature the kit supports but this repo hasn't yet adopted.
