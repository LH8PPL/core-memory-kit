The kit avoids server infrastructure and external API keys, instead installing directly into Claude Code via hooks. EverOS validates this thesis — same markdown-based design, but EverOS requires server + cloud APIs (OpenRouter + DeepInfra), making it a different product class.

**Trade-off:** EverOS is more capable (shipped semantic search; principled reflection model). **Kit wins:** for its goal ("make my agent remember, no setup, no server, no keys"), EverOS cannot compete without infrastructure.

**Why:** Design choice (D-23) is validated by peer comparison. Zero-infrastructure is the kit's value prop and differentiator from peer systems.

**How to apply:** When evaluating features or changes, prioritize zero infrastructure and zero API keys. Use EverOS as a reference for "opposite architecture, same thesis."
