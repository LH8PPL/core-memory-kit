Anthropic's native Auto Memory and core-memory-kit both inject at session start. Doctor warns about HC-6; remedy available: `cmk disable-native-memory`

**Why:** Double layer can cause redundancy or confusion; knowing the condition and remedy helps avoid debug cycles

**How to apply:** Check `cmk doctor` for HC-6 warnings; if undesired, run `cmk disable-native-memory`
