Task 149 (recall-trigger sweep) analyzed closed products (Cursor, Kiro, ChatGPT, Antigravity) for recall architecture. Finding: none use per-query semantic retrieval as primary path; all converge on "deterministic bounded injection + model-judgment for deeper pulls"—exactly matching the kit's "snapshot + judgment-pulled ladder" design.

**Why:** Validates kit's current architecture aligns with production systems

**How to apply:** Reference this finding when justifying architectural choices or planning recall enhancements
