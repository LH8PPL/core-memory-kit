The V3 `preToolUse` delete-guardrail hook does not fire on kiro-cli V3. This is a documented limitation in v0.4.0, not a regression. V3 redesigned the hook layer (Task 166); kiro-cli's built-in shell-approval mechanism covers destructive operations instead.

**Why:** Prevents shipping with an uncaught assumption that the guardrail works everywhere. Limitations must be explicit and justified.

**How to apply:** Document in v0.4.0 release notes. Link to Task 166 redesign. When Task 166 ships, revisit whether the gap can be bridged.
