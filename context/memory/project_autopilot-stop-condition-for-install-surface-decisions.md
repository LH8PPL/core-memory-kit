When a task decision affects install surface (package.json, npm dependencies, node:sqlite experimental status), assistant stops and escalates to user for explicit direction rather than deciding autonomously.

**Why:** Install-surface changes have high blast radius and warrant explicit user judgment.

**How to apply:** In future work, recognize install-surface implications and escalate for decision before proceeding.
