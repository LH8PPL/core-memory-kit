The snapshot builder must not import the sqlite index. This is a structurally-pinned invariant; failure to observe it could silently break the design.

**Why:** The hint build composes three pieces (FTS5-backed hint, existence advertisement, Memora refinements). The import-pin is the one place the build could break a hidden structural requirement without obvious failure symptoms.

**How to apply:** When reviewing the implementation, verify the snapshot builder does NOT import the sqlite index. Call this out explicitly in code review if the implementer's design introduces any cross-layer imports.
