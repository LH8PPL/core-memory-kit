Auto-extract frequently times out under load (observed: 7 timeouts to 1 success in a sampling window) but recovers automatically and silently once load drops. No manual retry or fix required; the system self-corrects across sessions.

**Why:** Prevents false conclusions about tool failure — timeouts don't mean permanent breakage; they often resolve in the next session when system resources free up.

**How to apply:** If auto-extract appears to have captured nothing in a session, don't assume it's broken. Check again after load decreases or in the next session.
