- **v0.4.0** = Kiro + per-agent adapter seam infrastructure (seam is the real v0.4.0 work; Kiro is first consumer)
- **v0.4.1** = Cursor (locked)
- **Ordered tail, cut-to-patch on ship** (not pre-numbered): Codex → Antigravity → gemini-cli → opencode → cline/roo/windsurf/…
- Cross-agent breadth is the v0.4 differentiator; subsequent agents are patch-level polish
- Extends D-127 (Kiro-first)

**Why:** Clarifies v0.4.0 ships infrastructure + first integration. Explains tail strategy: agents are patch-level, numbered only at ship time.

**How to apply:** Reference this roadmap when planning Task 50 and v0.4.1+ agent integrations. Verify each new agent against seam infrastructure.
