1. Cut the release locally first (so the artifact reports the correct version).
2. Build and test the artifact.
3. Tag and push the tag last (triggers CI publish).
Critical: cutting locally FIRST ensures the version is embedded in the artifact before testing. Reversing this order breaks version detection.

**Why:** Ensures tested artifact has correct version; prevents testing stale code or artifacts reporting wrong versions.

**How to apply:** Always follow this sequence. The guide (docs/process/cut-gate.md §0) documents this explicitly.
