- npm tarball intentionally ships **only `README.md`** to keep the package lean
- Deeper docs (`docs/CLI.md`, `docs/MCP.md`, `docs/KIRO.md`) are on GitHub only—not in tarball
- npm README links to deeper docs via absolute GitHub URLs
- npm README is kept comprehensive (includes full CLI table); root README can be leaner
- This creates a "hybrid" where npm page is a richer standalone landing, but tarball stays small

**Why:** Balances fast npm installs (lean tarball) with a complete npm landing page for package evaluation; GitHub is the canonical deep-docs home

**How to apply:** When adding/maintaining docs, keep only README.md in npm tarball. Ensure npm README is fuller than root README and includes full CLI reference. Link to GitHub docs via absolute URLs so npm visitors can reach them.
