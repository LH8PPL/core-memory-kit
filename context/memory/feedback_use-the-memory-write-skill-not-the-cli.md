Capture facts in conversation via the memory-write skill / mk_remember MCP tool — NOT by shelling out to `node bin/cmk.mjs remember` in Bash.

**Why:** The user noticed the agent used Bash (`node bin/cmk.mjs remember`) instead of the kit's own memory-write skill / mk_remember MCP tool. Both reach the same safe write path, but the skill/MCP is the intended in-conversation capture mechanism — using the kit's own surface is the whole point (dogfooding + it's exactly what a real user's agent does). Shelling out also risks shell-mangling of backtick/quote-heavy rationale, which the structured MCP params avoid.

**How to apply:** When the user says "remember / note / save / from now on / we decided" (or a durable preference/decision/env fact arises), invoke the memory-write Skill — it prefers the mk_remember MCP tool when the cmk server is connected and falls back to the CLI internally. Never type the cmk CLI by hand for a normal in-conversation capture. (Driving the CLI directly is fine only for gate-testing/verifying CLI behavior, not for capturing.)
