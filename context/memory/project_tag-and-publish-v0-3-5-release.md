From C:\Projects\claude-memory-kit:
```powershell
git tag v0.3.5
git push origin v0.3.5
```
Triggers publish.yml: suite run + npm publish (with provenance) + GitHub Release auto-generation.

After publication, reinstall locally:
```powershell
cmk install --with-semantic
```

**Why:** Release commit b4ecf78 is on main and ready; tagging is the publish gate that automates npm and GitHub release

**How to apply:** Tag when ready to ship; ensures global cmk gets the new version after npm publishes
