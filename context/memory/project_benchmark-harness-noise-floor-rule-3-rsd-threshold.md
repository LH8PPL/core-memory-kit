The performance benchmark harness refuses to report a verdict if measurement noise (RSD) exceeds 3%.
- If RSD ≥ 3%: report INCONCLUSIVE with numeric RSD value
- If RSD < 3%: report verdict (PASS/FAIL) with confidence
- Laptop-class hardware typically shows ±8–22% noise
- Dedicated CI runner infrastructure shows near-zero noise

**Why:** Implemented to ensure harness honesty after the user's earlier question "do you get the same results?" This prevents false verdicts on noisy hardware and makes measurement limits transparent.

**How to apply:** When interpreting benchmark results, check the RSD figure. INCONCLUSIVE means the environment is too noisy for a reliable verdict; PASS/FAIL with RSD < 3% is trustworthy. To get a real verdict on task 141b, wire the bench into a dedicated CI runner (~20 min estimated setup).
