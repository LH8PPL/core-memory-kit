Agents applying D-153 discipline to source reading:
- Separate explicit, traceable claims (metrics, direct quotes) from author interpretation or speculation
- Attempt to verify key claims against primary/authoritative sources
- Report verification failures honestly (HTTP errors, unreachable links, inaccessible content) rather than omitting them
- Flag which findings came from the original source vs. the reading agent's inference
- Note intermediate/supporting claims that secondary sources revealed (e.g., intermediate percentages the primary article missed)

**Why:** Research workflow requires notes that clearly distinguish source-backed facts from interpretation. Downstream synthesis tasks depend on knowing what can be cited to the original author and what is agent inference.

**How to apply:** When spot-checking completed research notes, verify they follow D-153 discipline. When briefing agents on a research task, communicate this standard explicitly.
