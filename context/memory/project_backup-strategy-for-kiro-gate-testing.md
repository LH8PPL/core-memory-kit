Before running the Kiro gate test, isolate the real user config to prevent contamination:
- **Move** real user tier (`.claude-memory-kit`) to `run4-.claude-memory-kit` (numbered sequence, away from clean start)
- **Copy** `.aws` (preserve original in place, don't move)
- **Preserve** old backups (`run`, `run2`, `run3`) untouched
- **Track** in NOTES.md which files are KIT-WRITTEN (deleted on restore) vs user-written (preserve)

**Why:** The Kiro gate test requires a clean environment without existing user config, but the real config and credentials must remain restorable. This approach enables both safely.

**How to apply:** Before running `cmk install --with-semantic --ide kiro` in a fresh test directory, apply this named-backup pattern to isolate the real state.
