The claude-memory-kit repository maintains its own `context/` memory system as a working demonstration. The first `MAP.md` commit in the dogfood repo proves the system renders and links correctly end-to-end.

**Why:** The kit's own memory is not just documentation—it's active validation that the system works.

**How to apply:** When developing memory features, treat the kit's own memory state as the primary test. Validate new changes against how they affect the kit's own fact rendering and wikilink graph.
