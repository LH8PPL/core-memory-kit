- **Root cause:** Kiro IDE 1.0 USER_PROMPT hook var arrives empty → capture-prompt no-ops → auto-extract misses user turn → nothing saved
- **Fix:** captureTurn recovers user turn from `payload.user_message` (Kiro Stop hook already reads), masks it, writes transcript in user→assistant order (PR #267, commit 0335c60)
- **Review:** self-review caught PII-masking gap; code-review caught transcript data-loss bug B1; both fixed + tested
- **QA:** full suite 2829/2829, stress 5/5, all CI green
- **Deployment:** global cmk v0.5.0; required killing `cmk mcp serve` PIDs 16228, 9736 first (to clear D-302 lock)
- **Proof procedure:** live Kiro test in fresh folder — state casual preference without mk_remember, restart Kiro, new session, `cmk search` should find it with `write_source: auto-extract`

**Why:** Auto-extract broken on Kiro blocked D-303 and broke parity with Claude Code; this fix enables fact capture from Kiro sessions without manual commands

**How to apply:** Run proof test in new Kiro project. If `cmk search` returns the stated preference with write_source: auto-extract, D-303 is closed.
