The release process is gated in three phases:

**§0a: Prepare & Verify**
- `git checkout main; git pull`
- `npm run release -- minor` (bumps version, updates CHANGELOG.md, resets [Unreleased])
- `git diff` to verify changes
- Stage ONLY `CHANGELOG.md` and `packages/cli/package.json` — exclude context files (they are dogfooding artifacts from the kit capturing its own development facts)

**§0b: Test Artifact**
- `npm pack` to verify the artifact builds
- Install and test the real package (not the source)

**§0c: Backup Dirs**
- Back up any real directories before installing over them

**Staging rule:** Never stage context/ changes in release commits. The kit automatically captures facts about releases (backup-convention discovery, gate structure, etc.) into context/MEMORY.md and context/memory/INDEX.md. These are dogfooding artifacts and do not belong in the release commit. Stage only CHANGELOG.md + packages/cli/package.json.

**Version strategy:** Use `npm run release -- minor` for features. Minor bumps for new capabilities; patch for bug fixes.

**Post-release:** After every ★ in the gate passes, run: `git tag v<version> && git push origin HEAD --tags` to trigger publish.yml (npm + GitHub Release).

**Why:** This workflow is repeatable and ensures releases are clean (only version and changelog land), verified before committing, and properly tagged for automation.

**How to apply:** Before each release, follow the gate document (§0a → §0b → §0c). Stage only the two intended files. The context files will always drift due to dogfooding; use `git status` to confirm before each `git add` command.
