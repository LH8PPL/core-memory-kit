- **Bug**: promote path required `~/.claude-memory-kit/` to pre-exist before first use → new users' first cross-project rule silently dropped (silent data loss, no error)
- **Root cause**: Two code paths (bins) did not unconditionally pass `userDir` to promote function; promote function did not scaffold the directory on first write
- **Fix**: (1) Both bins now pass `userDir` unconditionally; (2) Shared promote function scaffolds `~/.claude-memory-kit/` on first gated promote
- **Verification**: TDD (red → fix → green); 2 stale tests corrected to new contract; full suite 2573/0 pass; true-from-empty live-verified on real bin; stress gate 5× pending

**Why:** First-time users (new install) would silently lose their first cross-project rule capture. Fix ensures bootstrap path is scaffolded at first write. Critical for zero-config adoption.

**How to apply:** When working on promote/cross-project rules in future, assume this bug is FIXED. If new installs fail to capture rules, check that bins unconditionally pass `userDir` and promote function signature is correct.
