Guardrail changes are validated via a two-pass review that includes primary-source fact-checking against actual code/research, not just proposals. This process catches both logical errors (e.g., wrong Kiro assumptions) and implementation bugs (e.g., data-loss bypasses).

**Why:** The two-pass review with primary-source verification is the project's quality gate for guardrail PRs.

**How to apply:** Future guardrail work should expect this review depth. Prepare source citations and be ready to have assumptions fact-checked against the actual codebase.
