Tags pushed to remote trigger publish.yml. If tag (e.g., v0.4.3) doesn't match package.json version (e.g., 0.4.4), workflow publishes under wrong version. Verify before push. After push, check `npm view @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit version` and `gh run list --workflow=publish.yml --limit 3`.

**Why:** Accidental tag/version mismatches trigger unintended publishes to npm.

**How to apply:** Before pushing tag, verify it matches bumped package.json. After pushing, verify with npm view and gh run list to catch mismatches early.
