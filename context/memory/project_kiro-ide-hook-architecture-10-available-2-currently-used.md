Kiro IDE exposes 10 hooks total: Pre Tool Use, File Save, and 8 others (not yet leveraged by kit). Pre Tool Use + File Save are key for implementing remaining observe-edit + prompt-capture parity legs in both CLI and IDE.

**Why:** Kiro's full hook surface is now understood; reveals capacity for remaining features without architectural surprises.

**How to apply:** When building observe-edit + prompt-capture, plan to use Pre Tool Use + File Save hooks in Kiro IDE alongside CLI-equivalent triggers.
