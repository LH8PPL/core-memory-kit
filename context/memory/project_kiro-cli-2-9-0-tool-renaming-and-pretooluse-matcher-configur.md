**Tool rename:** kiro-cli 2.9.0 renamed the shell execution tool from `execute_bash` → `execute_command`.

**Documentation lag:** Official kiro-cli docs still reference `execute_bash`, but the actual binary uses `execute_command`.

**preToolUse hook matcher:** The hook matcher must use the actual tool name. In 2.9.0, setting `matcher: execute_command` (not `'*'` or `execute_bash`) is required for preToolUse to fire on shell commands.

**Status:** D-198 agentSpawn/capture/inject logic is proven. preToolUse matcher fix is pending user confirmation via a fresh `ls` command test.

**Why:** The hook location fix (D-198) was confirmed correct, but hooks weren't firing because the matcher didn't align with the actual 2.9.0 tool name. This explains the discrepancy between docs and runtime behavior.

**How to apply:** When setting up kiro-cli guards and hooks in v2.9.0+, use the literal tool name (`execute_command`) in matchers, not documented names. Sync matcher names against actual kiro-cli output, not docs.
