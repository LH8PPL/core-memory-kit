kiro-cli has two potential MCP server sources: the agent's global config (`~/.kiro/agents/cmk.json` with inline `mcpServers.cmk` entry) and the project's settings (`~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json`). Current ambiguity: docs do not specify which kiro-cli uses. This is dangerous because:

- Project mcp.json has `env.CMK_PROJECT_DIR` baked in (the mk_remember routing fix)
- Agent config entry lacks the env → if kiro uses it instead, routing fails silently
- Silent failures caused the data-loss bug the live test surfaced

**Recommended fix:** Remove `mcpServers` from agent-config and set `includeMcpJson: true` to force kiro to use project mcp.json (single authoritative source).

**Why:** Ambiguous MCP source selection creates composition bugs that static tests cannot detect. Only live integration testing caught the silent data-loss risk. Consolidating eliminates ambiguity and makes the system predictable.

**How to apply:** Before the live kiro-cli recall test, implement consolidation (Option B) so the test validates the fix without hitting a second source-precedence issue.
