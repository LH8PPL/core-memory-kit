Same-delivery tasks depend on peers' *planned* outputs before they are *live*. Task 237 (shipped) initially referenced Task 240's deliverable (`.nvmrc` pin, unshipped, same lane). The latent bug was caught because the job was drafted against intended deliverables. This is the caller-map discipline applied across task boundaries.

**Why:** Catches inter-task dependencies and latent failures where one task assumes a peer's output exists prematurely.

**How to apply:** For same-lane tasks, check dependencies, reference only currently-committed values, and document which peer owns each structural change. Let the owning task sweep all references when it ships.
