Use `cmk forget` to remove facts; it tombstones them (recoverable in `archive/tombstones/`). Never hand-delete memory files.

**Why:** Safety and reversibility prevent loss of facts removed in error; critical for dogfood extraction cleanup

**How to apply:** For contaminated, duplicate, or stale facts, use cmk forget instead of file deletion
