- **Repository**: https://github.com/RyjoxTechnologies/Octopoda-OS — MIT-licensed, Python+JS, ~535 stars, v3.0.3 (April 2026)
- **Storage model**: SQLite (local-first) or Postgres+pgvector
- **Key capabilities**: loop-detection engine (retry, oscillation, ping-pong, reflection, recall loops), hash-chained audit trails, live dashboard, MCP server, LangChain/CrewAI/AutoGen integrations
- **Design stance**: observability-first with memory attached (opposite of kit's memory-first with observability). Uses opaque database rows, not markdown-in-git.
- **Two potentially relevant patterns**: (1) loop detection—kit gap, adjacent to v0.6.3 health work (Tasks 250, 212). (2) Hash-chained audit—may be overkill for single-user local kit, but relevant if team tier (Task 127) ships.
- **Assessment caveat**: README-level only; code not verified. Field pattern (mem0, MemOS, Letta) shows READMEs often over-promise vs actual code.
- **Next step**: queued for targeted code review before influencing kit design.

**Why:** User surfaced as a research reference. Loop detection addresses a capability gap adjacent to v0.6.3's emerging health theme.

**How to apply:** Reference during health/failure detection work; verify code before adopting patterns. Use as comparison point if kit pursues loop detection.
