Daniel Miessler's PAI (15.8k stars, very active) independently converged on a memory taxonomy nearly identical to the kit's:
- WORK ≈ our scratchpad/Active Threads
- KNOWLEDGE ≈ our typed fact files
- LEARNING ≈ our Task 55 (meta-patterns)
- OBSERVABILITY ≈ our 104.1 Tools blocks
- STATE ≈ our session registry/now.md

Notable differences:
- PAI has **RELATIONSHIP** category (assistant's notes about collaboration: what frustrated the user, what worked, how they reacted); the kit lacks this
- PAI avoids vector search entirely; relies on grep/plain-text only

Architectural difference: PAI is a "cathedral" (monolithic, author-specific setup); the kit is a "brick" (composable, 30-second install into any project).

Philosophy alignment: PAI's stated principle — "everything should be transparent and parsable — by you, by your DA, by `rg`, by anything else" — is verbatim the kit's paradigm, now with 15.8k-star external validation.

**Why:** Independent convergence strongly validates the kit's memory taxonomy and paradigm. The RELATIONSHIP category is a genuine gap—tracking collaboration evolution could inform Task 55 (meta-learning). The architectural framing clarifies the kit's unique value proposition: composability and zero-friction adoption.

**How to apply:** Use as evidence for the kit's design soundness. Investigate RELATIONSHIP-style tracking as future Task 55 input. Reference the architectural difference when discussing the kit vs. monolithic competitors.
