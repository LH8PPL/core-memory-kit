CONCLUSIVE cut-gate-v041e live test (updated Claude Code 2.1.x, pre-171 global cmk): the CC update does NOT fix the per-tool MCP permission prompt. With only mcp__cmk__* wildcard in settings.json allow-list, BOTH mk_search AND mk_remember prompted individually ("Do you want to proceed with mcp__cmk__mk_search/mk_remember?"). This validates Task 171 — the kit MUST allow-list the 11 specific mcp__cmk__<tool> names, not just the wildcard. Next: re-pack global cmk WITH 171, fresh folder, verify prompt-free.

**Why:** The user wanted to know whether the Claude Code update alone fixes the prompt-free regression before deciding if Task 171 is load-bearing. The live test answers it definitively: it does not.

**How to apply:** Re-pack + reinstall the global cmk (currently pre-171), then fresh folder + install + direct MCP capture should be prompt-free. If still prompting, escalate.
