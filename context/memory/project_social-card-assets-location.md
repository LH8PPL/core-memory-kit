og-image files (`og-image.png` and `og-image.svg`) are located exclusively in `docs/public/assets/`. No duplicates exist in `packages/cli/` or other directories.

**Why:** Prevents deploying stale images elsewhere; clarifies the single source of truth for social previews.

**How to apply:** When updating social card assets, edit only `docs/public/assets/og-image.*` files.
