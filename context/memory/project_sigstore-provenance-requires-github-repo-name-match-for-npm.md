GitHub Actions sigstore provenance validation blocks npm publish if the GitHub repository name doesn't match the `repository.url` in package.json. The repo name must be synchronized on GitHub before re-running the publish workflow; mismatched names prevent sigstore validation and block upload to npm.

**Why:** Provenance signing validates the publish source; without repo-name identity match, sigstore cannot confirm the package originates from the correct repository.

**How to apply:** When renaming a GitHub repo with an npm release, rename the repo on GitHub first, update local remotes, then re-run publish. Tag creation can precede the rename, but publish cannot.
