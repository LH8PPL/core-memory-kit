- Release commit: 38455dc (version bump)
- Docs commits: 8236411 (DJ4-live) + additional F-7b-live fix
- All 8 behavioral gates scanned; 2 vague gates (DJ4-live, F-7b-live) fixed
- Tag (v0.3.3): NOT YET PUSHED — user's next step after gate validation passes
- Tagging command: `git tag v0.3.3 && git push origin v0.3.3`

**Why:** Accurate pre-tagging state; unblocks final release step.

**How to apply:** Before tagging, run DJ4 terminal probe (terminal steps in DECISIONS.md recall gate) to verify gates work live in practice.
