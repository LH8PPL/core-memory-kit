When reinstalling `@lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit` via `npm uninstall -g`, if Claude Code is running, the OS file lock on `better_sqlite3.node` (native SQLite binding) prevents deletion/replacement. The uninstall fails or hangs.

**Why:** The Node.js native module loads the DLL into the process; the file stays locked until the process exits.

**How to apply:** Close Claude Code (or any process that loaded the module) before running `npm uninstall -g`. This releases the file lock. After uninstall succeeds, reopen to load the fresh DLL from the reinstalled package.
