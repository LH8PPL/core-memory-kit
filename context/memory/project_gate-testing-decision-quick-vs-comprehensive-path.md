Option A (stay on IDE 0.12.333): quick, no install needed, runs legacy KH1/KH2. Option B (upgrade to 1.0.52): comprehensive, live-verifies v1 IDE work built this session (50.N.3 + D-203). A skips v1 verification; B fully validates what was built.

**Why:** This session added v1 IDE integration; gate testing should verify it or explicitly acknowledge it unverified

**How to apply:** Recommend comprehensive path when new IDE features were built; use quick path only for smoke tests of stable code
