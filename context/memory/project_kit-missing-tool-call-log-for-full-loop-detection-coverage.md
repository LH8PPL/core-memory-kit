Kit writes audit.log, extract.log, and DECISIONS.md, which feed most of Octopoda's classifiers. Retry/nondeterminism detectors need a **tool-call log** (individual tool invocations, retries, outcomes) not yet implemented.

**Why:** Task 212 and Task 250 reference these detectors. Without tool-call logging, the kit can feed only "pure event log" classifiers, limiting detection scope.

**How to apply:** If implementing Task 212's full classifier suite, prioritize adding tool-call logging based on impact to Task 250's failure-detection requirements.
