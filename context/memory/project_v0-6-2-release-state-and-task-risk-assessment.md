**Shipped (2/5):** 237 (supply-chain watch), 240 (Node pin — code + doc complete, PR open)

**Remaining, risky mid-session:**
- 241: fact-walk dedupe — 10 modules, zero-test-edits constraint; mid-refactor failure is painful to recover
- 243: better-sqlite3 v13 — small code edit; real work is cross-OS install-matrix verification
- 245: npm silent-install — reproduction work with output capture

Context limit reached; starting 241 now risks half-applied refactor state.

**Why:** Guides next session on which work is safe vs. which must defer until fresh context available.

**How to apply:** Merge 240, file D-nnn gap task (both bounded). Defer 241/243/245; pick up cleanly from `tasks.md`.
