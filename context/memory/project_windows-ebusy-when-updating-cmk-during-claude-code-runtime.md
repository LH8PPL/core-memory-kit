npm update for CMK (and potentially other installs) fails with EBUSY on Windows if Claude Code desktop is running. The running process locks DLL files, preventing the npm update. Workaround: close Claude Code before running `npm install -g claude-memory-kit@latest`. Hit twice during testing.

**Why:** Real blocker for Windows users. The EBUSY error is cryptic with no guidance on the cause or fix.

**How to apply:** In update docs, add a platform-specific note under "Troubleshooting" or "Prerequisites": "On Windows, close Claude Code before running updates."
