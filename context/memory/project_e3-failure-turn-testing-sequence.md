Multi-step workflow to validate learn-loop failure signals in session `cut-gate-coldopen-v51`:

1. Paste: "Run `uv run pytest tests/test_nonexistent.py` and tell me what happens."
2. Pytest fails intentionally (test file doesn't exist)
3. Send a trivial second message (e.g., "thanks") — critical timing step
4. Report "done" and verify `trust-signals.log` for signal delta

**Timing detail:** The detached Stop-hook child judge runs outside the main turn and writes its signal a few seconds into turn N+1. The second message creates a window for the judge to complete before the session ends.

**Why:** E3 validates persona injection and failure-signal detection; the two-turn sequence captures both the failure outcome and the detached judge's log

**How to apply:** Always follow this exact sequence for E3 validation; never skip the second message—it's not optional
