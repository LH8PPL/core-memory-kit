- **Locked scope:** Tasks 153, 152, 147 + js-yaml security fix + README rewrite + CONTRIBUTING.md (all merged to main)
- **Release gate:** Task 141b (storage bake-off decision) — ships in v0.3.2 only if CI verdict is PASS
- **CI workflow sequence:** PR #190 (bench harness + CI job) must merge to main → user manually triggers "Run workflow" from Actions tab → CI bench runs on quiet runner → verdict (PASS/FAIL/INCONCLUSIVE, target < 3% noise) decides 141b inclusion

**Why:** v0.3.2 scope is locked; 141b is the sole pending decision before release can be cut

**How to apply:** Once #190 merges, user must trigger the CI workflow from Actions tab. Verdict decides 141b and unblocks v0.3.2 release.
