npm v12 (expected ~July 2026) disables install scripts by default. The kit's semantic backend setup relies on install scripts during installation. Task 141 (npm v12 readiness) must resolve this before the deadline—without it, fresh kit installs will fail silently. This is a hard blocking constraint on production deployment timing.

**Why:** npm v12 is a shipping reality; once it releases, any user installing the kit without the fix will silently fail. This is a critical production risk with an immovable deadline.

**How to apply:** Monitor Task 141 for resolution. If still open as July 2026 approaches, escalate above other v0.4.x work. Update this fact when Task 141 ships.
