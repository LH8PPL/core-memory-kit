Release validation is gated through numbered check groups:
- **G1-G7**: File-side checks (configuration, allow-list entries, skills, doctor)
- **B1-B4**: Behavior/functionality (autocapture with dedup, rich facts, persona promotion at trust:high, privacy/security gates)
- **D1**: Data recall (5/5 tests)
- **R1-R2**: UX & in-session feel (manual hands-on testing phase)
- **W1**: Skill gate (prompt-free skill fire)

Progression: Automated gates (G, B, D) must pass before manual testing (R, W). Release clearance is "full green" on all automated checks.

**Why:** Standardized gates catch regressions; each check owns a specific concern. Automation verifies what it can; in-session UX and skip-prompt behavior require hands-on testing.

**How to apply:** Use these labels when discussing validation progress. When you see "29/29 pass," that's all G/B/D checks. Next phase (R1-R2) is hands-on testing in the live session.
