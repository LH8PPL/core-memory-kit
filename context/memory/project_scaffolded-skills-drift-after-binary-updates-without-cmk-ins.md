- **What:** In dogfood repo, both memory-write and memory-search skills drifted from templates: memory-write's SKILL.md was missing entirely; memory-search's SKILL.md was stale (missing `decisions`-scope, weaker trigger descriptions).
- **Root cause:** `cmk install` last run before recent skill template updates shipped; scaffolded skills never refreshed, leaving dogfood install stale.
- **Kit tooling gap:** `cmk doctor` has no health check to detect when installed skills are out of sync with their templates.

**Why:** Stale skills silently under-perform (don't trigger), causing the agent to bypass them and hand-solve instead. This is also a real cmk doctor gap worth addressing for all users.

**How to apply:** In future dogfood sessions, if a skill isn't activating as expected, check whether it has drifted from template. After updating the kit binary, rerun `cmk install` to refresh all scaffolded artifacts. Document as a cmk doctor health-check candidate.
