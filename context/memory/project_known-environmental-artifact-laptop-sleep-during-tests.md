When laptop sleeps mid–stress-run, `--version` tests record 3–hour clock gaps, creating false negatives (test failures that are not real bugs, only timing artifacts).

**Why:** Distinguishing environmental failures from real bugs is critical for trusting test results and avoiding unnecessary debugging.

**How to apply:** Ensure machine stays awake during full stress gate runs. If `--version` tests show large clock gaps, investigate sleep activity rather than treating it as a real failure.
