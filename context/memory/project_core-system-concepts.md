- **Source-trust tiers** — evidence-before-belief governance model for facts
- **Distill chain** — central processing pipeline; refactored in Tasks 203/204 with provenance-pointer tracing
- **AutoMem** — automatic memory management subsystem; Task 212 provides behavioral dashboarding (write/search/redundancy metrics)
- **Stash** — fact/memory storage with curator references and contradiction-append semantics
- **ADR-0002** — validation evidence: extracted-fact stores score worse on governance than raw storage

**Why:** These concepts define the memory system's core architecture and governance trade-offs.

**How to apply:** Reference these in design discussions, task validation, and implementation decisions. Consult ADRs and research docs for rationale.
