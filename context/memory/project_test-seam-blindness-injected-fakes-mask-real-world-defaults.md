Recurring bug class: tests inject fakes at a seam, but the real production default at that seam is untested. When downstream behavior changes, the real default breaks.

Three instances this session:
- D-269: Kiro sessions got empty memory snapshot since v0.4.0 (fake inject masked real default)
- Cursor's `afterFileEdit`: wired in core but dead in profile (fake worked, real broke when changed)
- Task 198's semantic finder: inert real default, fake worked, real broke when changed

All three fixed the same way: drive the real default against real-shaped data in tests.

**Why:** Test seams designed for isolation can become blindspots; test and production defaults drift unnoticed.

**How to apply:** For seams with real defaults, pair each fake-injection test with a real-default test using real-shaped data. Audit seams in code review.
