- **RRF constant:** `k=60` is the standard academic/implementation default (not a free parameter to tune in isolation)
- **Retrieval order:** Retrieve all documents from *both* engines before applying RRF fusion, not top-k from each separately — truncating before fusion introduces "truncation bias favoring whichever ranker runs first"
- These are concrete implementation specifics for Task 178 (hybrid-search benchmark)

**Why:** The ML Mastery hybrid-search tutorial encodes real implementation details that avoid subtle correctness bugs.

**How to apply:** When 178 builds the RRF benchmark, use `k=60` as the default and retrieve-all-before-fusing as the baseline fusion pattern.
