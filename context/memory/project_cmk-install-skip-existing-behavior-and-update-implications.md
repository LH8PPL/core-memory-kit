On existing projects, `cmk install` (first-run or re-run) skips any file that already exists, to protect user edits.

**What refreshes on re-run:**
- ✅ CLAUDE.md managed block (marker-delimited, re-stamped each install)
- ✅ Hooks in settings.json (separate merge path, wired fresh)

**What does NOT refresh:**
- ❌ Skills in .claude/skills/*.md (skipped if they exist)
- ❌ Any other scaffold file (skipped if it exists)

**Consequence:** Stale kit-authored files persist silently when kit is updated. To fix a stale skill, must delete + re-install, or hand-copy from template—no in-place refresh command exists.

**Why:** This is the core D-343 gap. Users reasonably expect install to freshen kit-provided files, but skip-existing (meant to protect user edits) leaves obsolete scaffolds behind, creating silent divergence on update.

**How to apply:** Document this clearly in install guide. Until `cmk repair --skills` or doctor-tool drift detection ships, advise users that kit updates require manual skill deletion+re-install or hand-copy from template. Use the empirical test as validation proof.
