Research notes (type: reference) must include `id` and `title` frontmatter fields. Missing fields prevent indexing into the archive.

**Why:** Frontmatter is required for the fact archive to properly index and retrieve notes; without it, notes remain orphaned and unsearchable.

**How to apply:** Verify that any hand-written research notes have valid `id` and `title` in frontmatter before committing; fix missing fields immediately if discovered.
