Informational health check for scheduled-compaction liveness (answers "scheduler alive?"). Detects potential dead-scheduler scenarios. Never prescribes fixes. Scoped as dev diagnostic supporting kit development and power-user troubleshooting, not a required part of auto-heal flow.

**Why:** User confirmed it as a nice-to-have; valuable for observability without blocking correctness flow.

**How to apply:** Implement as optional diagnostic. When documenting, frame as "check HC-10 if scheduler looks dead" — never as a required fix step.
