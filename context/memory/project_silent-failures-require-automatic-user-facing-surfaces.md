Silent failures (e.g., memory extractor timeout, missing data) must surface automatically without user action. Users will not run diagnostic commands proactively.

Standard pattern:
- Automatic status-line output during session startup (every session)
- Emitted to user-display channel, not model-facing
- Non-verbose when healthy; shows detail when problematic

Doctor/diagnostic tools can coexist but serve power users, testing/gates, not the load-bearing surface.

**Why:** Users don't proactively run diagnostics; silent failures go unnoticed if surfaced only on-demand. Automatic subsystems must have default-safe, always-on visibility.

**How to apply:** Ensure failures surface in the user-display path every session (startup, context injection, etc.), not behind optional diagnostic commands. Diagnostic tools are additive, not primary.
