npm publish with sigstore validation verifies that package.json `repository.url` matches the actual GitHub repo identity. Mismatch → E422 error on publish. **Workaround:** rename the GitHub repo first, repoint local remote, then re-run publish.

**Why:** This prevented v0.5.4 from publishing until the repo was actually renamed; retrying without fixing the root cause would fail indefinitely.

**How to apply:** If a future publish fails with E422 from sigstore, verify GitHub repo name matches package.json, rename if needed, then retry.
