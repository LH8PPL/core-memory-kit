- **Capture (automatic):** the gate4 hook captures sessions without user action; evidence: now.md written with 3641 bytes in the tested kiro session
- **Inject/recall mechanism:** agentSpawn hook fires at session start and should recall memory automatically
- **Status:** automatic capture is proven; end-to-end recall injection still needs verification before fully claiming it
- **Why it matters:** the core value of claude-memory-kit (memory without manual intervention) is intact in kiro-cli, even if manual save is broken

**Why:** The whole point of the kit is "fire and forget" memory across sessions; this is the feature that matters most and the one that works

**How to apply:** When using kiro-cli, rely on automatic memory capture/recall (just works); don't attempt manual "remember this" commands (they fail due to kiro bug). Next session should verify end-to-end recall actually injects facts into conversation context.
