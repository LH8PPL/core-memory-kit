`scripts/validate-node-pin.mjs` was first new validator with no `tests/scripts-validate-*.test.js` counterpart. Module exports `findLiteralPins`/`checkNodePins` explicitly for testability; manual verification during review (planted bad value, confirmed failure, reverted) was not repeatable or CI-gated.

**Added**: 10 test cases covering happy path and allowlist-emptying regression.

**Why:** Project CLAUDE.md rule: "write the test first... never change the test to make it pass." Task 240 shipped untested, violating the rule.

**How to apply:** Any new `validate-*.mjs` script must ship with corresponding test file before merge. Tests are the safety net for future allowlist/pattern edits.
