Articles are staged to tasks with verdicts that:
- Classify the source type (e.g., "tutorial", "reference")
- Identify its contribution to the target task and prior understanding
- Highlight genuinely useful refinements or insights
- Reference prior work (task IDs, benchmarks, experiments) for context
- Include honest caveats about scope ("Honest limit: covers X but not Y")
- Stay in staging until user approves batch commit

**Why:** Ensures each ingested article's relevance, scope, and relationship to prior work are clear; enables principled decisions about what to keep, revise, or discard

**How to apply:** When staging an article, write a verdict in this pattern before batching for commit
