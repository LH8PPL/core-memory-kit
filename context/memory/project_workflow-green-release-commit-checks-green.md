A GitHub workflow run showing green status does not imply that all checks on a specific release commit are passing. During v0.6.1, the workflow was green but at least one individual check on the commit remained red. Never infer commit-level check status from workflow status.

**Why:** This divergence broke release confidence and caused a second verification pass. Workflow runs aggregate multiple check types; one check failure can be invisible at the workflow level.

**How to apply:** For release commits, query commit-specific check status directly (via GitHub API or UI) rather than inferring from workflow status. Verify "14/14 checks green on commit <hash>", not "workflow green."
