Claude Code evaluates bash commands per-subcommand. When a compound command starts with `cd <absolute-path> &&`, the `cd` operation itself isn't auto-approved (absolute-path `cd` is not allow-listed), causing the entire compound to prompt for permission—even if the trailing command (e.g., `cmk search`) is normally allow-listed.

**Why:** This is a documented edge case (gate doc D-80 / §16.57). It does NOT indicate a capture flow failure; gate sessions 1-2 confirmed the actual capture sequences were prompt-free. Future sessions may encounter this when running verification commands.

**How to apply:** If verification commands prompt unexpectedly, click Yes to proceed—the operation succeeds regardless. To avoid the prompt, run commands from the project directory and omit the `cd <path> &&` prefix.
