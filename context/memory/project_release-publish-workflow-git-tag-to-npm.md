1. Tag locally: `git tag v0.3.2`
2. Push tag: `git push origin v0.3.2`
3. Triggers `publish.yml` workflow → runs full test suite → publishes to npm with provenance badge
4. GitHub Release auto-created from CHANGELOG [version] section
Post-publish verification: `npm view @lh8ppl/claude-memory-kit version` (should match tag); npm page shows provenance badge; GitHub Release exists matching CHANGELOG

**Why:** Repeatable, verifiable release process ensures consistency, transparency, and auditability

**How to apply:** Use for all future releases (v0.3.3, v0.4.0, etc.); always complete verification steps before announcing
