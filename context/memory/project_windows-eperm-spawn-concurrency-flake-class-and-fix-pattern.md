The project encounters transient EPERM errors under 5× concurrency (pre-existing, not product bugs):
  - `npm pack` at vitest collection time transiently crashes with opaque error under spawn contention
  - Cleanup operations (`rmSync`) throw when OS handle-holds exceed cleanup budget (~1.5s)
  
  Fix pattern (following `renameWithRetry` precedent):
  - Use bounded retry + backoff for spawn-heavy operations (e.g., `npm pack`)
  - Make final cleanups best-effort (do not re-throw after retry loop)

**Why:** These are concurrency-class bugs that only surface under stress; the stress gate reliably flushes them before PR.

**How to apply:** When debugging transient test failures on Windows during spawn/cleanup, suspect EPERM under high concurrency → apply retry+backoff or make cleanup best-effort.
