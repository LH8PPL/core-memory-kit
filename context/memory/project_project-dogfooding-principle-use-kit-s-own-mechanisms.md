The kit project's core philosophy is "use the kit's own mechanisms, don't hand-edit." Hand-editing (even when effective) violates this principle and is itself evidence of a missing feature.

**Why:** The project's value is that users should be able to trust the kit to manage itself. When the kit maintainer hand-edits, it signals the kit is incomplete.

**How to apply:** Before reaching for manual file operations, check whether a kit command exists. If not, treat the absence as a finding and propose the missing feature (e.g., D-343) rather than working around it.
