- Run parallel background verification agents to check claims against primary sources
- Document findings with specificity: verdicts (CONFIRMED / ABSENT / CONTRADICTED) with line-item details on *where* found/not found
- Store findings as `docs/research/YYYY-MM-DD-<topic>.md` timestamped files
- After all agents complete, integrate in one batch commit covering: INDEX registration, SOURCES rows, DECISION-LOG, task annotations linking research to implementation

**Why:** Surfaces whether design claims are officially documented, speculative, or laundered from unofficial sources — critical for validating decisions (e.g., Task 95) against actual specs.

**How to apply:** When planning research tasks, set up parallel agents with explicit "open questions" checklist, document each finding with specificity, defer integration until all agents land.
