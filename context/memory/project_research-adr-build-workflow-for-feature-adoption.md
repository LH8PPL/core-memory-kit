When evaluating competing projects for mechanism adoption:

1. **Research Phase**: Deep code review (README → docs → code → gap analysis)
2. **Assessment**: Is it on-thesis? Already ahead? Genuinely novel?
3. **Task Filing**: Research/ADR tasks only (not build), with version scoping (v0.4.x)
4. **Decision**: Each research task leads to ADR that decides ADOPT/DEFER/REJECT
5. **Build**: Build tasks spawn only after ADOPT decision

**Task Deduplication**: Check "do we have a task?" before creating — no duplicate work across sessions.

**Why:** Prevents premature build commitment; makes design decisions explicit; keeps research findings organized in release planning

**How to apply:** Apply when researching competing projects; distinguish research/ADR tasks from build tasks when filing
