Workflow to validate cross-project rules are correctly captured and routed:
  1. Start a new Claude Code session on test directory (e.g., `C:\Temp\cut-gate-v044`)
  2. State the cross-project rule explicitly in a normal turn (e.g., "From now on, in every project I work on, always use `uv` for packages, never `pip`, and always run `ruff` before committing.")
  3. Wait ~30s for auto-extract to complete (detached subprocess)
  4. Verify rule appears in `HABITS.md` or `LESSONS.md` with `trust: high` + `write: user-explicit`, and `~/.claude-memory-kit/` directory is created

**Why:** Validates that explicitly-stated cross-project rules are correctly extracted, routed to harness memory, and tagged with high confidence

**How to apply:** Run this workflow after D-263 fix is deployed; close B3/B4 gates once verified
