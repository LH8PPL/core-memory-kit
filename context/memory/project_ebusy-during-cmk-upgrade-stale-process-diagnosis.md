EBUSY errors during global cmk upgrades are typically caused by stale `cmk mcp serve` processes from the old installation still holding file locks.

**Why:** These processes prevent file replacement during upgrade. Eliminating them resolves the issue.

**How to apply:** If upgrade fails with EBUSY, identify and kill lingering `cmk mcp serve` processes from the old global before retrying the install.
