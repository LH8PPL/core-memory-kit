Do not emit per-session warnings about failure modes the user cannot cause or cure. Reserve the notification channel for state changes and actionable remedies only.

**Why:** Repeating non-actionable reports train teams to ignore notifications and degrade signal-to-noise on real incidents.

**How to apply:** When designing failure reporting, ask "can the user fix this?" If not, design the system to self-heal first; report only if healing fails and a real action exists.
