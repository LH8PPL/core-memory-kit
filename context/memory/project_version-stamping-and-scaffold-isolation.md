Global package version is **separate** from project scaffolds.
- npm package carries binary + CLI
- Project's `context/`, `CLAUDE.md` block, hooks carry `:start vX` version markers
- `cmk install` or `/claude-memory-kit:bootstrap` idempotently re-stamps scaffolds with current version
- Updating package alone does NOT touch scaffolds

**Why:** This explains the silent failure: users update globally but forget per-project re-stamping, leaving mismatched versions. The separation is fundamental to the architecture.

**How to apply:** Document this plainly. Implement drift-check in `cmk doctor`: report "scaffold v0.3.3 but CLI v0.3.4 — run cmk install" to catch forgotten steps.
