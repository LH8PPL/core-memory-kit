SonarCloud's TypeScript analyzer can crash internally (e.g., "Debug Failure: No error for last overload signature" in `server.cjs:getResolvedSignature`) while linting specific files.

- **Attempt 1:** Analyzer crashes → SonarCloud aborts → red gate (exit code fails)
- **Re-run:** Same crash occurs but is tolerated (file skipped) → green gate (exit code succeeds)
- **The trap:** Green exit code does not mean linting succeeded; it may have skipped files due to internal crash

**Why:** CI gates become unreliable. Green re-runs can mask real failures, creating false confidence. This issue blocked v0.4.3.

**How to apply:** When SonarCloud flips red→green on re-run, always read full logs before trusting. Exit code is not authoritative. Task 187 filed to resolve (exclude problematic file or await upstream SonarJS fix).
