Kiro V3 (2.9.0+) broke the hook architecture, replacing it with `permissions.yaml`-based approval. The kit's native delete-guard (first-class integration) does not fire on kiro-cli V3; fallback is kiro-cli's built-in shell-approval prompt. Claude Code and IDE guardrails unaffected (they use different surfaces). First-class V3 hook support is deferred to Task 166.

**Why:** Breaking platform change; scopes v0.4.0 functionality and expectation. Honest limitation worth documenting rather than shipping broken behavior.

**How to apply:** When testing kiro-cli, expect native shell approval (not branded cmk guard). Do not file as a bug; reference Task 166 as the planned fix.
