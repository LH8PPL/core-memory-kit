- npm install/uninstall reliably works while Claude Code is still running
- User has successfully reinstalled packages mid-session without closing Claude Code across this project
- Contradicts typical better_sqlite3.node EBUSY locking issues
- Earlier caution about closing apps first was unnecessary in this environment

**Why:** User feedback + repeated successful pattern validate this as safe; file-locking concerns do not apply here

**How to apply:** Do not suggest closing Claude Code before npm operations; trust the user's established, working workflow
