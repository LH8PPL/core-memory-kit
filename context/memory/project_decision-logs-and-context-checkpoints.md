Project uses RESUME-HERE.md file and numbered decision items (D-###: D-192, D-193, etc.) to persist decisions and state across context compactions. Decision log items track major incidents, follow-ups, and key choices.

**Why:** With large codebases, Claude's context is periodically compressed. Decision logs and checkpoint files provide durable recovery points outside the conversation thread.

**How to apply:** On session resume or after context compaction, check RESUME-HERE.md and any D-### items to recover full project state and decision history.
