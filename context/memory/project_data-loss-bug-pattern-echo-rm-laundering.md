During the guardrail review (PR #218), a serious data-loss bypass was identified and fixed: shell command laundering via `echo && rm` sequence. This was one of two data-loss bypasses caught by the two-pass review process.

**Why:** This specific vulnerability pattern represents a real risk the project has encountered. Future reviews should watch for it.

**How to apply:** When reviewing guardrail or safety-critical code, flag command sequences that launder operations (echo, printf, etc.) as potential bypass mechanisms. Ensure test coverage for this pattern.
