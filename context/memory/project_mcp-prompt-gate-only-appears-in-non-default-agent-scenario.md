**cmk-default path:** cmk config has `includeMcpJson: false` → no MCP load, steers to pre-trusted shell commands (cmk remember/cmk search). Normal users on this path never see approval popup.

**Non-default path (e.g., kiro_default):** cmk is not active, project MCP loads, reaches for `mk_remember` → triggers approval prompt. One click accepts; documented behavior for non-default agents.

Implication: the prompt you see is expected *only* when cmk is not your global default. Normal users are unaffected.

**Why:** Distinguishes real bugs from configuration artifacts. Clarifies why you hit the gate (engineered non-default state) but an end user won't (on cmk-default).

**How to apply:** When investigating memory prompts or approval gates: check agent config first. If cmk-default, no gate. If non-default, gate is expected and should be addressed via design decision (not a quick patch).
