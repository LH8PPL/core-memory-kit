PR validation includes three gating layers: (1) local gates (full test suite + stress tests), (2) CI gates (CodeQL + others), (3) code review. All must pass before merge to main.

**Why:** Catches issues at multiple points before they reach main; reduces risk of broken mainline.

**How to apply:** Ensure all layers are green before initiating merge; use this as the checklist.
