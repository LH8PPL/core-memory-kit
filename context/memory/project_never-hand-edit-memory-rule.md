The project enforces a policy of not manually editing or deleting memory files after auto-capture. All post-capture curation (dedup, consolidation, cleanup) is performed by the system's automated sweeps, never by hand.

**Why:** Preserves the audit trail of what was auto-captured and ensures memory integrity is maintained systematically. Hand-editing would introduce inconsistency and bypass the dedup/consolidation logic.

**How to apply:** When reviewing memory and noticing near-duplicates, overlaps, or apparent redundancies, resist hand-deletion. Trust the automated dedup sweep to consolidate them over time. Accept that the capture process generates multiple angles on the same insight as a natural part of operation.
