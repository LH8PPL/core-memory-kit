Two fixes merged to complete Kiro IDE 1.0 support:
- **#232** — capture hook adapted to read from IDE 1.0's new session path (messages.jsonl adapter)
- **#233** — cmk install pre-writes permissions.yaml with skill/MCP/shell trust rules

Both verified end-to-end. System now works identically on three surfaces: Claude Code, kiro-cli V3, Kiro IDE 1.0.

**Why:** IDE 1.0 changed session storage location and introduced a new permission model; these fixes align the kit.

**How to apply:** If future IDE capture issues arise, reference these PRs. If a fresh install shows Allow prompts, check that cmk install correctly wrote permissions.yaml.
