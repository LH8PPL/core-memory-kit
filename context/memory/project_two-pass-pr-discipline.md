- On each review gate completion (skill-review, stress tests, etc.), scan findings and fix them inline in the branch.
- Open the PR only after all gates are green and findings are remedied.

**Why:** Maintains PR quality; reduces review feedback loops and back-and-forth.

**How to apply:** Follow the review sequence: tests → static analysis → stress testing → skill-review. Fix findings locally before opening the PR.
