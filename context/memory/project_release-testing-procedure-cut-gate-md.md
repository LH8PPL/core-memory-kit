Authoritative release test script at `docs/process/cut-gate.md` with three phases:
- **Section 0**: Cut release locally, build real tarball (no publish)
- **Sections 1–9**: Run all ★ checks, including new PR1–PR5 (§4d) for v0.4.3 persona-promotion features
- **Verdict section**: Final tag push only after all ★ checks pass
Assumes caller is on `main` after merge (or test from branch first, then merge).

**Why:** Self-contained release procedure guards against publishing incomplete/untested builds; centralized source of truth for release workflow.

**How to apply:** When preparing a release, enter `docs/process/cut-gate.md` and follow top-to-bottom. Stop if any ★ check fails. Only proceed to final tag push after all checks pass.
