To determine whether a SonarCloud analyzer crash originates from repo-side or server-side configuration, grep the entire repository (source, config files, tests, lcov, package.json) for the artifact/path mentioned in the error. If the artifact is not found anywhere locally, the problem is server-side, and repo-side fixes cannot resolve it.

**Why:** This proves the boundary of what can be fixed repo-side, preventing wasted iteration on repo changes that cannot work. Absence of the artifact locally is definitive proof of server-side origin.

**How to apply:** When SonarCloud analyzer crashes with file/path errors, grep the entire repo for the mentioned string; absence proves server-side origin and points to SonarCloud web UI (Analysis Scope) as the fix location.
