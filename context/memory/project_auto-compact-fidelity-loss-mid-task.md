Session auto-compaction that fires during a task loses context fidelity. This has occurred twice in recent work.

Sessions that continue past natural boundaries (rather than closing and restarting) are prone to compaction mid-task.

**Why:** Fidelity loss forces the next session to re-derive missing context, negating the kit's designed benefit of seamless continuity across boundaries.

**How to apply:** Close sessions at natural task boundaries (e.g., after shipping a release, before starting a new task). The kit's snapshot + breadcrumb mechanism is designed to preserve state across these boundaries.
