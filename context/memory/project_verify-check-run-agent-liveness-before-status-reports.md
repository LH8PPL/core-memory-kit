When assessing CI status, "running" does not guarantee a check is responsive. During v0.6.1, a review check was reported "running" but was actually dead for 54 minutes. Do not assume a "running" state is current; verify actual responsiveness or recent activity timestamps before declaring check status.

**Why:** False "running" reports can mask real failures or delay diagnosis during release verification.

**How to apply:** Before reporting CI checks as "green," spot-check agent health via timestamps or recent activity. If a check claims "running" but hasn't updated in a suspicious window, investigate directly.
