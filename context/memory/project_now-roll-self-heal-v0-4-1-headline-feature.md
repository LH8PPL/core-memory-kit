The now-roll feature auto-detects and self-heals `claude --print` format changes across releases.

Both test scenarios PASS:
- Detects format drift when `claude --print` output structure changes
- Auto-runs recovery without manual intervention
- Verified against real, unmodified `claude --print` output (not mocked)

**Why:** Claude releases change output format; the kit must detect and adapt automatically to avoid breaking memory extraction in live sessions

**How to apply:** After any Claude version bump, if extraction starts failing, NR1 self-heal will trigger; monitor logs for "now-roll" recovery messages
