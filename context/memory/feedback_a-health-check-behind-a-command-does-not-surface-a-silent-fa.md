A health check behind a command does NOT surface a silent failure - it relocates it. A user never runs cmk doctor unprompted, so any signal that only appears there reaches only someone who ALREADY suspects a problem. The kit's real unprompted channel is the SessionStart systemMessage status line (inject-context.mjs:1097, buildStatusLine): systemMessage is the USER-DISPLAY channel while additionalContext is model-facing (the D-116 primary-source finding), and the kit already emits exactly one such line per session with zero commands.

**Why:** The user's catch on Task 242: 'what does a doctor check help? a user will never run a doctor check.' I had specified the fix for a SILENT failure as a doctor check - violating D-169 (any capability claimed automatic needs a criterion asserting the automatic path with NO manual command) inside the very task written to enforce it.

**How to apply:** When surfacing any automatic-path failure: put the signal in the SessionStart systemMessage status line first (unprompted, already shipped, silent-when-healthy), and treat a cmk doctor HC-* as the SECONDARY diagnostic for someone already investigating - never the only surface. Done-criterion must be 'the warning appears with no command run', tested by driving the real bin.
