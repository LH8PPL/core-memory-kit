The kit's install command skips files that already exist (install.mjs:214). This means a scaffolded skill that becomes stale after a template update cannot be fixed via `cmk install` — the command won't overwrite it. The fix requires manual replacement (`cp` from template) or kit-level mechanism (currently absent, see D-343).

**Why:** Explains why assistant reached for manual `cp` instead of `cmk install`, and identifies a real mechanism gap in the kit.

**How to apply:** When fixing stale scaffolded skills, use manual copy from template; propose `cmk repair --skills` or similar as a forward fix (D-343).
