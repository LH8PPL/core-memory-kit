Task 243 (2026-07-21) SUPERSEDED the bench-storage allowlist constraint: the LITERAL_ALLOWLIST in validate-node-pin.mjs is EMPTY again and bench-storage.yml reads node-version-file .nvmrc like every workflow. The old fact 'the entry must NOT be emptied' (P-A3LFDBR9) described the D-384 world where .nvmrc was 20, below node:sqlite's 22.5 floor. Task 243 raised .nvmrc to 22 (better-sqlite3 v13 engines floor; Node 20 EOL), so the crash reason evaporated and D-383's join-the-pin argument won. Do NOT restore the allowlist entry.

**Why:** A stale memory saying 'do not remove this entry' would make a future session treat the now-correct empty allowlist as a regression and re-add a divergence whose reason no longer exists.

**How to apply:** The invariant is CONDITIONAL and lives in tests/scripts-validate-node-pin.test.js: .nvmrc major >= 22 means bench-storage must be ON the pin and the allowlist empty; < 22 means the entry is required. Trust the test, not the old fact.
