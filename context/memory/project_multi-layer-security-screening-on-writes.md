Every committed-tier write (persistent storage mutations) gates through: curate/distill input+output, transcript promotion (withhold-not-defer principle, secrets-only visibility), persona queue, trust-increase re-screening. Poison_Guard side-door checks on entry/exit. PR #216 closes all known side doors.

**Why:** High-stakes data mutations need layered defense against poison-pill attacks and secret leakage.

**How to apply:** When adding write operations, build screens at curate→distill→transcript→trust stages. Use Poison_Guard check. Mark sensitive data for secrets-only handling.
