The kit dual-emits and supports both IDE 0.x (legacy) and 1.0+ (v1 format). Either version runs the gate with different probe sets:
- IDE 0.x: KH1/KH2 legacy capture+inject probes
- IDE 1.0+: KHv1-* modern probes (delete-guard, observe-edit, auto-load, Stop trigger)

**Why:** Provides flexibility in testing; choice is scope (quick/legacy vs. comprehensive/modern), not compatibility

**How to apply:** When choosing test environment, remember both are valid; decide based on verification scope needed
