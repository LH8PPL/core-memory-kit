Architecture review recommends extracting a Compaction-State module (Candidate 1, highest strength). Currently "did compaction succeed recently?" is scattered across presence sentinel, mtime marker (read/written by 5 callers), and per-date logs with no single owner.

Extracting this module directly solves the compaction/cron bug class AND implements Task 167.A, 167.D, 167.F as callers. The v0.4.1 bug-fix and architecture improvement are the same work.

**Why:** Scattered state-ownership is the root cause of the bug. Architecture review and bug analysis converged on the same solution.

**How to apply:** Design Compaction-State's interface first (last-success query/update), then refactor all callers to use it. Unifies logic and fixes bug class in one sweep.
