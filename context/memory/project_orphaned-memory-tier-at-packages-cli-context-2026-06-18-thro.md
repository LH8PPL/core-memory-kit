Location: `packages/cli/context/`

Contents:
- 6 fact files
- 1 review-queue entry
- Extract logs and transcripts through 2026-07-12
- None of these 7 items exist in root `context/` tier

Root `now.md` shows a gap (14:20 → 14:59) covering the entire Task-241 window, indicating facts were written to this orphaned tier.

Path is gitignored (`.gitignore:111`, added 2026-06-13) — no privacy exposure but demonstrates the design bug.

**Why:** Capture-hook bins default `projectRoot: process.cwd()` without root-discovery walk, creating tiers in any subdirectory they're invoked from.

**How to apply:** Recover the 7 facts into root tier during v0.6.2 remediation. Preserve the stray tier as evidence during investigation; do not delete.
