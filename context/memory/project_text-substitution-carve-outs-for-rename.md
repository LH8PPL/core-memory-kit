Three families must be manually reviewed before any bulk find-replace in tier 3:

  1. **Config directory** (`~/.claude-memory-kit/` in tier-paths.mjs:112) — needs migration logic, not text swap.

  2. **Frozen historical records** (`docs/adr/`, `docs/journey/`, `docs/conversation-log/`, `archive/`) — describe the project at the time they were written; do not edit.

  3. **Agent-neutral names** (`cmk` binary, `MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR` env var) — leave unchanged.

**Why:** Blind find-replace orphans user data, erases historical context, and breaks portability.

**How to apply:** Carve out these paths before bulk substitution. Grep to verify no replacements occur in these families.
