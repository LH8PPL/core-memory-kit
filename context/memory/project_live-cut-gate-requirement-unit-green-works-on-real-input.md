The binding verification rule for critical paths is that unit test passage does not guarantee live correctness. Critical tasks (e.g., Task 161 retry logic) require a live cut-gate test against real Haiku before task completion. Task 161.11 (exercise retry on real Haiku end-to-end) is the final gate before shipping.

**Why:** Unit mocks diverge from production behavior; transient Haiku failures are real and can only be validated by exercising the real service.

**How to apply:** For tasks touching critical paths (retry, compression, session lifecycle), include a live smoke/gate test in the final subtask before marking complete.
