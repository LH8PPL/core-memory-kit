When a service degrades or falls back to reduced functionality, include a user-facing suggestion for recovery. Example: when mk_search falls back to keyword-only, suggest `cmk install --with-semantic` to the user. Do not degrade silently or without explanation.

**Why:** Users need to understand why behavior changed and what they can do. This is the UX standard for degradation in this project.

**How to apply:** When implementing graceful degradation, add a message explaining the fallback and suggesting the upgrade or workaround.
