`subcommands.mjs` attempts the semantic backend for `--scope decisions` even though `search.mjs` already validates that decisions is keyword-only. The semantic backend correctly rejects it, then the search command prints a scary stderr warning: "semantic default unavailable (unknown-scope:decisions) — falling back to keyword". This makes the working, intentional design look broken. The message is indistinguishable from the stale-MCP-server bug the guide warns about.

**Why:** The default search mode is hybrid (attempts semantic first), and the code does not short-circuit for decisions scope before attempting semantic. `search.mjs:163` has explicit validation that decisions is keyword-only, but `subcommands.mjs` ignores this and tries semantic anyway, generating a false-failure warning for expected behavior.

**How to apply:** Fix by skipping the semantic backend entirely when `scope === 'decisions'` — go straight to keyword silently, with no warning. This is a small, targeted v0.3.3 patch that should ship before the release tag, not defer to v0.3.4.
