On Windows, `npm uninstall` after building `better_sqlite3.node` fails with EPERM (permission denied) because the compiled DLL remains locked by the Node process. The packages are removed despite the error; the leftover temp dir is cosmetic cruft.

The kit acknowledges this as a known annoyance. (Node:sqlite would sidestep it via async DLL handling, but was rejected for perf reasons.)

**Why:** EPERM during teardown/rebuild is a frequent false alarm on Windows. Knowing it is harmless and expected prevents misdiagnosis and unnecessary re-runs.

**How to apply:** If EPERM appears during `npm uninstall` on Windows, check that "removed N packages" still printed. If yes, the uninstall succeeded; the locked DLL is expected. No action needed.
