To safely test `cmk install` without corrupting the user's actual memory setup:
- Create a fresh, empty project folder (not this repo)
- Set `MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR` environment variable to a temporary directory (e.g., `C:\Temp\cut-gate-v0.3.3\_user\`)
- This isolates both project-level memory (`context/` fresh scaffold) and user-level memory (`~/.claude-memory-kit` equivalent)
- After testing, both folders can be deleted safely

**Why:** Install flows write memory files. Testing against real setup risks data loss or corruption.

**How to apply:** Before `cmk install`, `export MEMORY_KIT_USER_DIR=<temp-path>` and scaffold the project in a sibling clean folder.
