For auto-promotion and similar features, the pattern is: silent default (runs without user orchestration, per D-169), plus optional warmth (e.g., an in-conversation "I promoted X" mention). This avoids both manual-ritual overhead (their anti-pattern) and silent opacity.

**Why:** Combines external warmth (proposing promotions) with internal automation philosophy (no manual trigger required). Tested decision: D-169 forbids manual rituals; optional mention adds transparency without gating.

**How to apply:** When adding cross-project features, default to silent auto-run. If warmth/approval is needed for UX, add as optional mention or query, not a gate or command.
