Any code touching spawn boundaries must pass `npm run stress` (5 consecutive runs) before merge.

**Why:** Spawn-boundary code is concurrency-sensitive and unit tests alone do not surface race conditions or transient spawn failures under load.

**How to apply:** Before marking a PR ready for review, run the stress suite as a pre-merge gate for any changes to compress, distill, or curate paths.
