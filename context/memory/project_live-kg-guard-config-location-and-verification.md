The live KG-guard matcher config is at: `~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/q_cli_default.json`
Target field: `hooks.preToolUse[0].matcher`
After fix is applied, this should be `'*'` (not the old pipe-string format like `'execute_bash|executeBash|shell'`)
Verify with: `node -e "console.log(require('~/.aws/amazonq/cli-agents/q_cli_default.json').hooks.preToolUse[0].matcher)"`

**Why:** KG-guard reads this live config, not the source code. An outdated config means the test exercises old behavior even if the code was fixed.

**How to apply:** After running `cmk install`, always verify this file has the correct matcher value before running KG-guard tests.
