Version: 4.2.0 (in package-lock.json)
js-yaml parses/writes frontmatter for all context/memory files
Any version bump requires `npm test` + `npm run stress` validation against current main

**Why:** Frontmatter parsing is core to memory I/O; regressions break context persistence

**How to apply:** Never merge js-yaml Dependabot PRs on stale CI; verify locally with full suite
