Do not read unshipped same-lane task deliverables in job configs. Example: job read `node-version-file: .nvmrc`, which Task 240 (unshipped) is supposed to pin. This creates latent failure at scheduled 06:23 UTC run with no PR context to notify. Fixed by matching existing job literals; Task 240 owns the sweep when it ships.

**Why:** Scheduled jobs run without human supervision; config errors don't surface until automation fires, by which time no PR provides context.

**How to apply:** Use only currently-committed config values. Defer structural changes to the task that owns the new value.
