Running `npm install -g …@latest` from inside the repo directory exits with success (exit 0) but leaves the old version installed. Running from a neutral working directory succeeds properly. The failure is only detectable by explicitly verifying the resulting version.

**Why:** Silent failure creates user experience bugs. Users following documentation showing repo-directory installs will silently get stale versions and encounter unexpected behavior. Undetected by standard install confirmation flows.

**How to apply:** Avoid global npm installs from inside project directories when feasible. If publishing install instructions involving global packages, test the repo-directory scenario and document it or recommend a neutral cwd. Always verify with explicit version checks after package-manager operations.
