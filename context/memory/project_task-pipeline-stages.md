Workflow progresses through standard stages: Stress re-gating (initial validation, ~10 min) → PR → CI → merge → housekeeping, with next task queuing at the end

**Why:** Recurring structure observed across Tasks 74, 144, 145; understanding stages helps predict throughput and identify bottlenecks

**How to apply:** Track which stage a task occupies to estimate completion time and troubleshoot delays
