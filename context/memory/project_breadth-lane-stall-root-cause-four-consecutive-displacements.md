The v0.4.x breadth lane (one agent per patch) stalled after Kiro (v0.4.0), when Cursor was displaced by:
- v0.4.1: Task 167 (now.md-roll bug)
- v0.4.2: security patch 173
- v0.4.3: Task 151 (persona layer injection hole)
- v0.4.4: Task 66 (temporal) + riders

Each displacement was justified individually. Cumulatively, the lane never re-committed after the first one; it drifted forward four times.

**Why:** Understanding this as death-by-a-thousand-cuts (not a single bad decision) helps design a re-decision that sticks by accounting for how priorities actually shift, not assuming they won't.

**How to apply:** At v0.4.4 cut, when choosing among the three options, document the re-commitment explicitly so the next displacement is visibly a choice, not a drift.
