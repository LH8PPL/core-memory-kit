D-24 rule specifies that patch releases (vs. minor or major) do not require or trigger the D-248 backlog sweep. This is described as "the minor-boundary forcing function" — implying backlog sweeps are gated on minor/major boundaries, not patches.

**Why:** This rule shapes release-gate decisions and tells when a release path is "short" (patch) vs. requires additional review (minor/major boundaries)

**How to apply:** When classifying a release type, use this to determine if D-248 backlog sweep applies. For patches, it does not.
