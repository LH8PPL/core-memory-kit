For minor releases (unlike patches), the sequence is: backlog trigger-walk sweep → release mechanic → tag push. v0.6.2 carries a breaking change (Node-20-drop), making this a deliberate release. The tag push step is manual/user-gated (not automated). Tasks merged for v0.6.2: 237, 240, 241, 243, 245.

**Why:** Minor releases with breaking changes require backlog sweep and explicit user approval at tag time

**How to apply:** Apply this gate process to the next minor release; do not automate tag push for breaking releases
