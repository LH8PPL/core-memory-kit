Retry logic in Task 161 is configured differently by execution path to respect ceiling contracts:
- **Ceiling-free paths** (daily-distill, weekly-curate, lazy compress): `maxAttempts: 2` (one retry allowed)
- **SessionEnd-hook path**: `maxAttempts: 1` (no retry; delegates to lazy compress under D-175 composition contract)

This segregation allows transient failures to be recovered in unbounded contexts while preserving the 60-second ceiling in hook-constrained paths by delegating retry responsibility.

**Why:** The ceiling-free paths have time budget for retry; SessionEnd-hook is constrained and must fail fast to stay under 60s ceiling, shifting retry burden to the lazy path.

**How to apply:** When wiring retry into spawn boundaries, consult the execution context — if ceiling-free, allow retry; if hook-constrained, set maxAttempts=1 and rely on lazy fallback.
