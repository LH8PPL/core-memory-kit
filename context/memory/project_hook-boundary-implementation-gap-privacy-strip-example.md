- The `<private>` privacy-strip in `cmk remember`, `mk_remember`, and import was implemented only in the hook layer, not at the actual write boundary
- Result: `<private>` markers leaked to committed files; fixed in PR #179

**Why:** Single-point-of-enforcement (hook-only) misses actual file write operations; boundary violations slip through without file-verification checks

**How to apply:** For security/privacy features, verify implementation at both hook AND file-write boundary; use on-disk file verification to catch boundary gaps
