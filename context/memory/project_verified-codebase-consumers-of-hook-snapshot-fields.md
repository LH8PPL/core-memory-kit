Three identified callers of hook/snapshot data (blast radius verified clean):
- Claude bin — reads `.hookOutput`
- Kiro leg — reads `.snapshot`
- Cursor leg — reads `.snapshot`

No other consumers reference these fields.

**Why:** When modifying `.hookOutput` or `.snapshot` structure, all three consumers must be updated to avoid breakage. This is the complete dependency graph for these fields.

**How to apply:** Before shipping any change to these fields, verify all three consumers are compatible. Use blast radius check to confirm no undocumented dependencies exist.
