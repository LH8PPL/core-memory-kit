Shape field validated against 7-value enum. Invalid values rejected with schema errors (no file written). Error contract uses camelCase `errorCategory`. All 74 tests passing.

**Why:** Shape field is the foundation for fact classification in the writeFact slice; enables downstream features like auto-extract for ephemeral facts.

**How to apply:** Use as basis for 66.3 population strategy; shape-based auto-classification can identify Plan facts and auto-assign expires_at.
