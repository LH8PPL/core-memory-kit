Tag push to the repo automatically triggers the publish step. The user (operator) is responsible for pushing the release tag when code is merged and ready; publish automation follows deterministically.

**Why:** Separates user control over release timing from deterministic automation, preventing accidental early releases while keeping the publish step hands-free.

**How to apply:** When a release version (e.g., v0.3.3) is merged and ready to ship, push the release tag to the repo. This will trigger publish automatically.
