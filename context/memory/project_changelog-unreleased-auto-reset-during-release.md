The release automation (part of the publish workflow) automatically resets the [Unreleased] section in CHANGELOG after a version is published. The released version gets a [Version] header with a date; a fresh [Unreleased] skeleton is generated for the next development cycle.

**Why:** Eliminates manual post-release housekeeping; ensures CHANGELOG is always ready for the next cycle.

**How to apply:** Do not manually reset [Unreleased] when cutting a release. Verify post-release that [Unreleased] is present in CHANGELOG. If it's missing, the automation may have failed.
