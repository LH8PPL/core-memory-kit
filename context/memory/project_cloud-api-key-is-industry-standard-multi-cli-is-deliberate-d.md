Across 42 surveyed projects (including all major, well-funded ones like Supermemory, Honcho, OpenHands), the standard choice for background LLM invocation in memory/automation tools is cloud-API-key (direct calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.). Zero projects route through multiple agent CLIs for extensibility. codemem is the sole exception—and it is the reference the kit follows.

**Why:** Provides strategic context for design decisions. The kit's choice to route through the user's authenticated CLI is higher-risk but higher-value (no API key management, uses existing auth). This is not a mistake; it's the deliberate differentiation that makes the kit novel.

**How to apply:** When evaluating features or roadmap, remember this context. "Works off your existing agent login, no API key management" is why cloud-API is not an option.
