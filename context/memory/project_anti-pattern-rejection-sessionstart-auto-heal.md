Proposed adding SessionStart auto-heal to rebuild INDEX if drifted. Rejected as over-engineering.

**Reasons:**
- Adds I/O (fact-dir scan) to every session start — a hot-path penalty.
- Fixes a cosmetic lag in a convenience doc (nothing functional reads INDEX).
- Edge case: rare (INDEX lagged AND no capture since AND human opened INDEX AND noticed).

The kit's design ethos discourages "what if we also add X" feature creep.

**Why:** The incidental next-capture self-heal suffices. Hot-path cost is not justified for cosmetic drift.

**How to apply:** When evaluating SessionStart additions, prioritize hot-path performance. Prefer test-backed contracts over preventive machinery.
