User's preferred architecture pattern (`app/{api,services,repositories,schemas}`) is now in live persona tier (LESSONS.md + USER.md).

**Promoted**: Via auto-drain from stranded medium-confidence queue.

**Expected behavior**: New Python backend projects auto-scaffold with this layered structure.

**Why:** Architecture was described across projects (inferred vs declared) and stuck in medium-confidence queue; auto-drain moved it to live tier for consistent injection.

**How to apply:** When scaffolding new backends, expect layered structure to appear automatically without re-specification.
