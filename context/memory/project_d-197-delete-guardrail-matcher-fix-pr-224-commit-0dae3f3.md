The fix updates the guard matcher from a pipe-string pattern to `matcher: '*'` in the hook config.

**What changed:**
- Location: `hooks.preToolUse[0].matcher` in `q_cli_default.json`
- Old: pipe-string pattern (unreliably blocked deletes)
- New: `matcher: '*'` (wildcard, robustly blocks all deletes at the gate)
- Artifact version: 0.4.0
- Commit: 0dae3f3 (PR #224, now merged to main)

**Expected runtime behavior:**
When a user attempts `rm -rf context/sessions` in Kiro, the guard intercepts it with message "BLOCKED by the claude-memory-kit delete-guardrail…" and `context/sessions` survives the blocked attempt.

**Why:** The old matcher pattern failed to consistently intercept delete commands. The wildcard matcher is more robust and catches all deletion attempts.

**How to apply:** After merging guard-related fixes, rebuild (`npm pack`), reinstall globally and in the gate project, then verify the config JSON has the wildcard matcher before running the live re-test.
