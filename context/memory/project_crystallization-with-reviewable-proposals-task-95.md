When near-duplicate facts are identified:
- Produce a readable, reviewable **proposal** rather than silent merge
- Proposed fact includes `superseded_by` provenance pointing to what was absorbed
- User accepts or rejects before finalization

**Why:** Achieves memclaw's deduplication goal (rot elimination) while maintaining kit's transparency and audit trail

**How to apply:** Crystallization produces a fact diff; user approves; `superseded_by` links track absorbed facts
