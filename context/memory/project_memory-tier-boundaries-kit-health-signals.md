Kit-operational signals (errors, timeouts, health notices, scorecard snapshots, task status) never enter memory tiers (`additionalContext`, fact storage, session tiers). When a user-facing notice is needed, it uses the ephemeral `systemMessage` display channel: shown once, not remembered. Persistent tiers carry only mission context, user decisions, and project facts.

**Why:** Keeps memory focused on user project context rather than kit-internal operations. A remembered operational notice becomes a permanent nag; operational signals belong in transient reporting channels. Prevents pollution of the tier that should carry only durable project knowledge.

**How to apply:** When routing health or error signals, use ephemeral channels. Distinguish between kit-internal tooling *mention* (e.g., "npm CI failed") as incidental vs mission-relevant facts (e.g., "watch CI on direct-to-main pushes"). Only mission-relevant facts are durable.
