A test fixture contained hardcoded `2026-07-07` date within a 14-day lookback window. When the current date crossed the window edge (2026-07-21, 12:10 UTC), the test failed deterministically. Fixed with relative dates and incident documented at the helper.

**Why:** Time-dependent test fixtures decay predictably and exemplify Task 236's thesis on rot. Hardcoded windows are a hazard class that requires relative dates as remedy.

**How to apply:** When tests fail coincidentally (not correlated to recent commit changes), check for hardcoded dates or time-sensitive thresholds. Favor relative dates in fixtures to prevent future window-crossing failures.
