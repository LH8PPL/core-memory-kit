    // overhead, so several I/O-heavy + subprocess-spawning tests that sat just
    // under 10s on v2 now need more headroom (esp. on slower filesystems /
    // under --coverage). A genuine hang still blows 30s. Pathologically-heavy

    // run keeps the console `default` reporter AND writes a structured json
    // result file, so a failing run is never undiagnosable. The json reporter
    // is a side channel — it doesn't change console output, TTY detection, or
    // timing (unlike a stdout tee). The outputFile lives at test.outputFile (NOT
    // baked into the reporter tuple) so the CLI `--outputFile.json=<path>` that
    // `npm run stress` passes OVERRIDES it per run (unique path under
