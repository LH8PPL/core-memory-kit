# How researched products implement skills (survey → Task 69.0)

## Why this research

Lior 2026-06-01: after we found the kit's own `memory-write` skill is stale + unsafe (D-28 / Task 69.0 — it grants `Read Edit Write` and tells Claude to **hand-edit** MEMORY.md, bypassing Poison_Guard + home-path sanitization = the F1 leak class), he asked: *"go over every product we researched/checked, for skills, see if any of them have similar skills and how they do it. you can also check antigravity-awesome-skills."* Goal: extract the right SKILL.md pattern for the rewrite.

## Per-product findings

| Product | Memory skill? | Write mechanism | Frontmatter shape |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **gstack** (`/learn`) — closest analog to memory-write | YES — manages structured "learnings" (type/key/insight/confidence) | **Calls a BINARY**: `~/.claude/skills/gstack/bin/gstack-learnings-log '{json}'` via `Bash`. Does NOT hand-edit for adds. (Prune re-writes via Edit.) | `name`, `description`, `triggers: [list]`, `allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Write, Edit, AskUserQuestion, Glob, Grep]`, `version`, `preamble-tier` |
| **gstack** (`/context-save`) | freeform checkpoint dump (not structured facts) | Hand-writes a markdown checkpoint via `Write`, but **sanitizes the slug in bash first** + a body gate "HARD GATE: Do NOT implement code changes." | `name`, `description`, `allowed-tools: [Bash, Read, Write, Glob, Grep, AskUserQuestion]` |
| **claude-mem** (`mem-search`) | YES — but **RECALL, not write** ("the canonical memory skill"); ~15 skills total, only 2-3 memory | capture is via hooks/MCP, not the skill | (MCP-backed) |
| **memsearch** (`memory-recall`) — our Layer-5b lineage, a real Claude Code plugin | YES — **RECALL** (search→expand→transcript, progressive L1/L2/L3) | **`allowed-tools: Bash` ONLY** — invokes `memsearch search/expand` CLI; read-only, never Edit/Write. Runs in a **forked subagent** (`context: fork`) so recall doesn't pollute main context. | `name`, `description` (embeds the when-to-use heuristic — "use when 'what did I decide about X'… skip when purely current code"), `context: fork`, `allowed-tools: Bash` |
| **antigravity-awesome-skills** (`agent-memory-systems`) | reference/teaching skill (how to build memory: semantic/episodic/procedural) — not a write-tool | delegates to libraries/services (LangMem, vector DBs); does not hand-edit | `name`, `description`, `risk: safe`, `source`, `date_added` |
| **antigravity-awesome-skills** (`agent-memory-mcp`, `mesh-memory`) | recall/search over a hybrid store | MCP / mesh workflow | community `risk/source/date_added` |
| **claude-remember** (`/remember`) | a slash command to save | we **rejected** the slash-command in favor of phrase-triggers (research 2026-05-21) | — |
| **Hermes** (`tools/memory_tool.py`) — the system we modeled on (162K★) | add/replace/remove **function-calling TOOL** (no memory SKILL.md; its `skills/` are all domain skills) | **ALL writes go through the tool**: caps (MEMORY 2200 / USER 1375 — our USER cap came from here) + dedup + **threat-scan for injection/exfiltration before write (= our Poison_Guard)** + **external-drift detection that REFUSES hand-edits not round-tripping its parser** (backs up to `.bak`). System prompt gets a frozen snapshot; tool returns live state. | function tool, args `action`/`target`/`content`/`old_text`; routing via `target` (memory or user) |
| **basic-memory** | user-explicit capture via `<retain>` tag | tool/tag | — |

## The biggest finding — read their actual CLAUDE.md files (not just SKILL.md)

Lior pushed: *"did you read the claude.md AND skill.md of the other products?"* — so I read the real files, not our notes. The decisive insight is in the **CLAUDE.md** side:

| Product | Its CLAUDE.md | Does it inject into the USER's CLAUDE.md? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **memsearch** | ~240 lines, facts+pointers, "a reference map not a procedural manual" — points to the `memory-recall` skill + `memsearch` CLI | **NO** — delivers via the plugin (hooks + skill); the user's CLAUDE.md is untouched |
| **gstack** | **~2,800 lines** — heavy monorepo dev doc (CI contracts, invariants) | **NO** — installs skills to `~/.claude/skills/gstack/`; doesn't touch the user's CLAUDE.md |
| **claude-mem** | present at root (dev doc) | **NO** — delivers the `mem-search` skill + MCP tools via the plugin |

**Every product's CLAUDE.md is its OWN development documentation** (length varies wildly — 240 to 2,800 lines — because it's *their* repo, not a user artifact). **None of them write anything into a user's project CLAUDE.md.** They deliver memory capability to users **exclusively via skills + hooks (the plugin)**. → **Our kit's npm route, which appends a ~60-line memory-write procedure into the user's CLAUDE.md, is the outlier — nobody else does this.** This is the clinching argument for Task 69.3: deliver via the skill, leave the user's CLAUDE.md alone (the kit's own scaffolded `CLAUDE.md` loader block should shrink to a few facts + a pointer, or move to `.claude/rules/`).

## Cross-product patterns (the actionable signal)

1. **Safe structured WRITE = route through the project's CLI/binary via `Bash`, never hand-edit.** gstack `/learn` is the cleanest example: structured facts (with validation/dedup/confidence) go through `gstack-learnings-log`, NOT the Edit tool. The reason is exactly ours: only the tool enforces schema/dedup/safety. **Our rewrite must do the same — call `cmk remember` via `Bash(cmk*)`, not Read/Edit/Write the memory files.** (gstack only hand-writes for `/context-save`, which is a freeform dump — and even then it sanitizes the slug in bash first.)
2. **`allowed-tools` must include `Bash`** to invoke the CLI. Our current skill grants `Read Edit Write` (no Bash) — which simultaneously (a) makes it *unable* to run `cmk` and (b) *enables* the unsafe hand-edit. Flip to `Bash(cmk*)` + `Read` (for the dedup pre-check), and drop `Edit`/`Write` to memory files.
3. **Skills split write vs recall; the canonical memory skill is often RECALL** (claude-mem `mem-search`, antigravity `agent-memory-mcp`). Capture is usually automated (hooks) with the skill as the explicit override — which is exactly the kit's design (auto-extract = capture; skill = override). **Candidate:** add a `cmk search` recall skill too, not just memory-write. (Beyond Task 69; note it.)
4. **A hard safety gate in the skill body is common** (gstack: "HARD GATE: Do NOT implement code changes"). Our rewrite should carry an explicit gate: **"NEVER hand-write `context/memory/` — always `cmk remember`."**
5. **Frontmatter**: everyone uses `name` + `description` + an `allowed-tools` + a "when to use" mechanism (`when_to_use` / `triggers` / folded into description). Anthropic's standard ([skills doc](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills)) is `name`/`description`/`allowed-tools`/`disable-model-invocation`/`disallowed-tools`. Our frontmatter shape is fine; the body + tool-grant are the problem.
6. **Skills-as-installable-package is the norm** — antigravity ships a `npx … --claude` installer that drops skills into `.claude/skills/`; claude-mem ships ~15; gstack ships 23. Validates Task 69.1 (`cmk install` scaffolds skills into `<project>/.claude/skills/`).

## Verdict → the Task 69.0 rewrite spec

Rewrite `memory-write/SKILL.md` to the **gstack-`/learn` pattern**:

- **Frontmatter:** keep `description` + `when_to_use` (Anthropic-valid); set `allowed-tools: Bash(cmk*) Read` (Bash to run the CLI; Read for the dedup pre-check). **Remove `Edit`/`Write`.**
- **Body:** instruct Claude to capture via **`cmk remember "<fact>" --why … --how … --type …`** (rich, safe path: Poison_Guard + home-path sanitization + schema). For remove/replace, use the corresponding `cmk` verbs. **Hard gate:** "NEVER hand-edit `context/MEMORY.md` or `context/memory/*` — that bypasses the safety screen; always go through `cmk`."
- **Drop** all dev-repo internal references (`packages/cli/src/…`); the user has `cmk` on PATH, not the kit source.
- **One source** (Task 69.2): this rewritten file is the single source both the plugin route and `cmk install` scaffold from.
- **Candidate (note, not in 69):** a companion `memory-search` skill wrapping `cmk search` (the recall half, which is the canonical memory skill in claude-mem/antigravity).

## ADDENDUM (2026-06-03) — Anthropic's AUTHORITATIVE skill-authoring guidance

The user: "in the research, does it say how to write the skill? … first check claude docs about skills … then look at all the other products." The product survey above was done against the OLD [code.claude.com/docs/en/skills] (Claude Code). Re-checked the AUTHORITATIVE platform docs ([best-practices](https://platform.claude.com/docs/en/agents-and-tools/agent-skills/best-practices), overview, quickstart) + the [skill-creator](https://github.com/anthropics/skills/tree/main/skills/skill-creator). The product-pattern verdict (route writes through `cmk` via `Bash`, drop Edit/Write, hard gate) is VALIDATED. Refinements + one correction:

- **Frontmatter = `name` + `description` (the two required fields).** `name`: ≤64 chars, lowercase/numbers/hyphens, NO reserved words ("anthropic"/"claude"); gerund form preferred (`capturing-memory`) but noun-phrase (`memory-write`) is "acceptable". `description`: ≤1024 chars, non-empty.
- **CORRECTION to our spec above:** there is **NO separate `when_to_use` field** in the authoritative platform spec — the **when-to-use is embedded IN the `description`**, written in **THIRD PERSON** ("Captures … Use when the user says 'remember this' / 'from now on' / 'we decided X' …"), NOT "I can help…". The description is THE critical field (Claude selects the skill from it). _(Claude Code's own skills doc historically allowed `when_to_use`/`allowed-tools`; for the Claude-Code-delivered skill we keep `allowed-tools: Bash(cmk*) Read` per that route, but the when-to-use must ALSO live in `description` so model-invocation works.)_
- **Body:** CONCISE — don't explain what Claude already knows; **<500 lines**; **LOW degrees of freedom for fragile/safety-critical ops** ("Run exactly this", "Do not modify the command") — exactly the posture for a safety-critical memory write; **hard gates use MUST/NEVER** ("NEVER hand-edit `context/memory/`"); **forward-slash paths only**; if it grows, progressive-disclosure into reference files **one level deep** from SKILL.md.
- **Process (skill-creator + best-practices):** evaluation-driven — establish a baseline (we HAVE one: the current live-verify runs), write minimal instructions to pass, iterate by observing real usage. "Claude understands the skill format natively" — no special tooling needed to author.

**Refined 69.0 spec (supersedes the bullets above):** `name: memory-write` (or `capturing-memory`); `description:` third-person what+when (triggers embedded); `allowed-tools: Bash(cmk*) Read`; body = LOW-freedom `cmk remember "<fact>" --why --how --type` (+ remove/replace verbs), a **MUST/NEVER hard gate**, forward-slashes, no dev-repo paths, <500 lines. **Still to pull verbatim from the skill-creator:** the exact SKILL.md scaffold template (fetch the skill-creator repo's SKILL.md when writing 69.0).

## Provenance note

Our `memory-write` is our own authored synthesis (Task 24): action model (add/replace/remove) ← **Hermes** `memory` tool; phrase-triggers chosen over **claude-remember**'s `/remember`; `<retain>` idea ← **basic-memory**; consolidation ← **Hermes**. The rewrite adds the **gstack `/learn`** route-through-the-binary safety pattern. Nothing lifted verbatim.
